              "content": "# AvroProducer Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThe `AvroProducer` class is designed to read ride data from a CSV file, serialize it to Avro format, and then publish it to a Kafka topic. It utilizes the OpenCSV library for reading the CSV and the Kafka client libraries for producing messages to the Kafka topic. The use of Avro ensures that the data adheres to a defined schema, which can facilitate data integrity and interoperability across different systems consuming the messages.\n\n## Dependencies\nThe class relies on several external libraries:\n\n- **OpenCSV**: A library for reading and writing CSV files.\n- **Kafka Clients**: Libraries for producing messages to Kafka, including configuration for security using SASL_SSL.\n- **Confluent Kafka Avro Serializer**: For serializing the messages into Avro format, which is crucial when interacting with a schema registry.\n\n## Initialization\n### Constructor\nThe constructor of the `AvroProducer` class initializes a `Properties` object required for configuring the Kafka producer. It sets the following parameters:\n\n- **Bootstrap Servers**: The address of the Kafka cluster.\n- **Security Protocol**: Ensures secure communication using SSL.\n- **SASL Configuration**: Provides credentials for authentication to access Kafka and the Schema Registry.\n- **Producer Configurations**: Defines how data is serialized and acknowledged.\n\nThese configurations ensure that the `AvroProducer` can securely communicate with Kafka and properly serialize messages in Avro format.\n\n## Reading Ride Data\n### Method: `getRides()`\nThe `getRides()` method is responsible for reading ride data from a CSV file located in the resources. It performs the following tasks:\n\n- Accesses the `rides.csv` file as a resource.\n- Skips the header row of the CSV file using `CSVReader`.\n- Reads all remaining rows, mapping each row into a `RideRecord` object, which is a structured data type representing the rides.\n\nThe fields filled in the `RideRecord` include:\n\n- `vendorId`: Extracted f",

It orchestrates the overall flow of the application:\n\n1. **Instantiation**: It creates an instance of `AvroProducer`.\n2. **Reading Rides**: Calls `getRides()` to fetch the ride records from the CSV.\n3. **Publishing to Kafka**: Passes the retrieved `RideRecord` list to `publishRides()` to send them to Kafka.\n\nThis straightforward flow encapsulates the functionality of the program, transforming CSV data into Kafka messages for further processing.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `AvroProducer` class effectively bridges the gap between static ride data contained in a CSV file and dynamic stream processing through Kafka. By leveraging Avro for serialization and following a structured approach to error handling and message acknowledgment, it ensures efficient and reliable data transfer. This design can be extended or modified for other data sources or target topics with minimal adjustments to the existing methods.",

The method works as follows:\n\n- Creates a new instance of `KafkaProducer` using the previously set properties.\n- Iterates through each `RideRecord`, sending it as a `ProducerRecord` where the key is the `vendorId` and the value is the `RideRecord`.\n- Uses a callback to log any errors that occur during sending.\n- Prints the offset of each successfully sent record to the console.\n- Introduces a small delay (500 milliseconds) between sending records, to manage production rates and reduce load.\n\nThis method handles the core functionality of producing messages to Kafka, ensuring reliable communication and acknowledgment of sent messages.\n\n## Execution Flow\n### Method: `main(String[] args)`\nThe `main()` method serves as the entry point for the application.
