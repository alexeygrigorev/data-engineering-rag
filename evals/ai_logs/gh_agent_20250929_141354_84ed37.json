This ensures clarity when we join the two DataFrames by retaining distinct column names for each taxi type.\n\n## Joining Green and Yellow Revenue Data\n\nNow we will join the two DataFrames based on the common columns `hour` and `zone`.\n\n```python\ndf_join = df_green_revenue_tmp.join(df_yellow_revenue_tmp, on=['hour', 'zone'], how='outer')\n```\n\nWe perform an outer join, which ensures that all records from both DataFrames are included, even if some entries do not match.\n\n## Writing Combined Revenue Data to Disk\n\nAfter merging the two DataFrames, we save the combined data.\n\n```python\ndf_join.write.parquet('data/report/revenue/total', mode='overwrite')\n```\n\nThe joined DataFrame is written to disk, allowing for future access and analysis.\n\n## Loading Combined Revenue Data for Analysis\n\nWe can now load the combined revenue data from the output.\n\n```python\ndf_join = spark.read.parquet('data/report/revenue/total')\n```\n\nThis command reads the previously saved joined revenue DataFrame back into Spark for a",

A temporary bucket for GCP Dataproc is also set to handle intermediate files during execution. This ensures that Spark processes the data efficiently.\n\n```python\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\nspark.conf.set('temporaryGcsBucket', 'dataproc-temp-europe-west6-...')\n```\n\n## Reading and Preparing DataFrames\n\nGreen and yellow taxi data are read from Parquet files into separate DataFrames (`df_green` and `df_yellow`). The relevant datetime columns are renamed to provide a uniform schema.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet(input_green) \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n\ndf_yellow = spark.read.parquet(input_yellow) \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n```\n\n## Selecting Common Columns\n\nThe script extracts a predefined set of common columns from both DataFrames, ensuring that the data merged later will have a consistent schema. Each DataFrame is also tagged with a `service_type` column indicating the type of taxi (green or yellow).\n\n```python\ndf_green_sel = df_green.select(common_columns).withColumn('service_type', F.lit('green'))\ndf_yellow_sel = df_yellow.select(common_columns).withColumn('service_type', F.lit('yellow'))\n```\n\n## Combining DataFrames\n\nThe script combines the two DataFrames into a single DataFrame `df_trips_data` using the `unionAll` method. This union operation stacks the yellow taxi data on top of the green taxi data.\n\n```python\ndf_trips_data = df_green_sel.unionAll(df_yellow_sel)\n```\n\n## Registering Temporary Table\n\nThe combined DataFrame is registered as a temporary SQL table named `trips_data`. This allows SQL-style querying using Spark SQL syntax later in the script.\n\n```python\ndf_trips_data.registerTem",

The `common_colums` list will be used for further selections in our analysis.\n\n## Preparing Selected Data for Green Taxis\n\nNow that we have the common columns, we will create a new DataFrame that only includes these columns from the green taxi dataset and add a new column to specify the service type.\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\ndf_green_sel = df_green \\\n    .select(common_colums) \\\n    .withColumn('service_type', F.lit('green'))\n```\n\nWe select only the common columns and add a new column `service_type`, which indicates that these entries originate from the green taxi dataset.\n\n## Preparing Selected Data for Yellow Taxis\n\nFollowing the same approach for the yellow taxi dataset, we will create a similar DataFrame.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow_sel = df_yellow \\\n    .select(common_colums) \\\n    .withColumn('service_type', F.lit('yellow'))\n```\n\nHere, we execute the same selection and column addition process as we did for the green taxi DataFrame, but now specifying that the records are from yellow cabs.\n\n## Combining the Datasets\n\nNext, we will merge the green and yellow taxi DataFrames into a single DataFrame for a unified view of taxi trips.\n\n```python\ndf_trips_data = df_green_sel.unionAll(df_yellow_sel)\n```\n\nThe `unionAll()` function is utilized to concatenate the two DataFrames vertically, ensuring we maintain all rows from both datasets.\n\n## Counting Records by Service Type\n\nTo observe how many records exist for each type of taxi service, we can group the combined dataset by the `service_type` column and count the occurrences.\n\n```python\ndf_trips_data.groupBy('service_type').count().show()\n```\n\nThis operation groups the data and presents a count of trips for each type of taxi service, providing a quick overview of th",

Here\u2019s a brief example based on the process outlined in the course material:\n\n1. **Load the DataFrames**: Start by loading the green and yellow revenue DataFrames that you have saved in Parquet format.\n\n   ```python\n   df_green_revenue = spark.read.parquet('data/report/revenue/green')\n   df_yellow_revenue = spark.read.parquet('data/report/revenue/yellow')\n   ```\n\n2. **Prepare the DataFrames**: To avoid column name conflicts during the join, you should rename the columns that are common in both DataFrames.\n\n   ```python\n   df_green_revenue_tmp = df_green_revenue \\\n       .withColumnRenamed('amount', 'green_amount') \\\n       .withColumnRenamed('number_records', 'green_number_records')\n\n   df_yellow_revenue_tmp = df_yellow_revenue \\\n       .withColumnRenamed('amount', 'yellow_amount') \\\n       .withColumnRenamed('number_records', 'yellow_number_records')\n   ```\n\n3. **Perform the Outer Join**: Now you can join the two DataFrames on the desired common columns, such as `hour` and `zone`:\n\n   ```python\n   df_join = df_green_revenue_tmp.join(df_yellow_revenue_tmp, on=['hour', 'zone'], how='outer')\n   ```\n\n4. **Write the Combined Data to Disk**: After joining, you may want to save the combined DataFrame back to disk for future access.\n\n   ```python\n   df_join.write.parquet('data/report/revenue/total', mode='overwrite')\n   ```\n\nYou can adapt the actual column names and paths according to your specific context, but this forms the basis of performing an outer join on these two DataFrames.\n\nFor further details, the process is documented in the notebook titled [07_groupby_join.ipynb](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/code/07_groupby_join.ipynb).",
