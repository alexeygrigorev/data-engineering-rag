          "content": "To determine the estimated amount of data that will be read when executing queries on external and materialized tables in BigQuery, one approach is to examine the query execution plan, which includes the estimated bytes processed for both table types.\n\nAccording to the documentation, when querying a dataset, if you run a query that counts distinct `PULocationIDs`, you can expect different amounts of data read based on the table type. For example, one of the scenarios listed indicates that executing a similar query on an external table might read approximately **18.82 MB**, while the materialized table might read around **47.60 MB**. \n\nThis difference in estimated bytes processed arises from the underlying structure of these tables; external tables may require more aggregated reads, while materialized tables can optimize access patterns.\n\nFor your specific needs, you may need to execute your queries while checking the details provided in the BigQuery console, which will show the estimated bytes read for the executed queries.\n\nFor reference, you can find detailed information and examples in the course material, especially in [this homework document](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2025/03-data-warehouse/homework.md).",
