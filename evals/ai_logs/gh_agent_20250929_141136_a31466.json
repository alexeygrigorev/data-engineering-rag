The script includes functions for reading data from a Kafka topic, parsing it, and performing various aggregation operations before writing the processed data back to the console or Kafka.\n\n## Imports and Dependencies\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\nfrom settings import RIDE_SCHEMA, CONSUME_TOPIC_RIDES_CSV, TOPIC_WINDOWED_VENDOR_ID_COUNT\n```\n\nThe script begins by importing necessary libraries:\n- `SparkSession` is the entry point for using Spark SQL.\n- `pyspark.sql.functions` is imported as `F` for utilizing various built-in functions.\n- Configuration variables such as `RIDE_SCHEMA`, `CONSUME_TOPIC_RIDES_CSV`, and `TOPIC_WINDOWED_VENDOR_ID_COUNT` are imported from a `settings` module.\n\n## Kafka Data Reading\n\n```python\ndef read_from_kafka(consume_topic: str):\n    # Spark Streaming DataFrame, connect to Kafka topic served at host in bootrap.servers option\n    ...\n    return df_stream\n```\n\nThe `read_from_kafka` function establishes a connection to a specified Kafka topic. It uses the Spark Streaming API to create a streaming DataFrame, which allows real-time ingestion of data. The DataFrame's starting offsets are set to 'earliest', ensuring it captures all available messages. The function returns the streaming DataFrame for further processing.\n\n## Parsing Kafka Messages\n\n```python\ndef parse_ride_from_kafka_message(df, schema):\n    \"\"\" take a Spark Streaming df and parse value col based on <schema>, return streaming df cols in schema \"\"\"\n    ...\n    return df.select([field.name for field in schema])\n```\n\nThe `parse_ride_from_kafka_message` function takes in a streaming DataFrame and a schema. It converts the 'value' column from Kafka messages into multiple columns based on the provided schema. The function utilizes Spark SQL expressions to cast the relevant fields and returns ",

              "content": "## 0. Spark Setup\n\nTo begin using Apache Spark with Kafka and Avro data formats, we need to configure the environment and establish a Spark session. This is essential for executing our data processing tasks.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS'] = '--packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.3.1,org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.12:3.3.1 pyspark-shell'\n```\n\nThis code sets the necessary loading parameters for PySpark, including packages for Kafka and Avro support required during runtime.\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nimport pyspark.sql.types as T\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\nspark = SparkSession \\\n    .builder \\\n    .appName(\"Spark-Notebook\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nHere, we create a `SparkSession`, which is the entry point for using the DataFrame and SQL API in PySpark. The application is named \"Spark-Notebook\" for easy identification in Spark's UI.\n\n## 1. Reading from Kafka Stream\n\nWe will now read data from a Kafka stream using PySpark's `readStream` method. This provides a way to continuously read streaming data into a DataFrame.\n\n### 1.1 Raw Kafka Stream\n\n```python\n# default for startingOffsets is \"latest\"\ndf_kafka_raw = spark \\\n    .readStream \\\n    .format(\"kafka\") \\\n    .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"localhost:9092,broker:29092\") \\\n    .option(\"subscribe\", \"rides_csv\") \\\n    .option(\"startingOffsets\", \"earliest\") \\\n    .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"checkpoint\") \\\n    .load()\n```\n\nThis block reads from a Kafka topic named \"rides_csv\". The `startingOffsets` option is set to \"earliest\", meaning data will be read from the beginning of the topic, and a checkpoint location is set to enable fault tolerance.\n\n```python\ndf_kafka_raw.printSchema()\n```\n\nWe print the schema of the raw Kafka DataFrame for verification. This will show the structure of the data we are reading, including key-value pairs.\n\n### 1.2 Encoded Kafka Stream\n\n```python\ndf_kafka_encoded = df_kafka_raw.selectExpr(\"CAST(key AS STRING)\",\"CAST(valu",

Go to some other directory, e.g. `~/tmp`.\n\nDownload a CSV file that we'll use for testing:\n\n```bash\nwget https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv\n```\n\nNow let's run `ipython` (or `jupyter notebook`) and execute:\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\ndf = spark.read \\\n    .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\\n    .csv('taxi_zone_lookup.csv')\n\ndf.show()\n```\n\nTest that writing works as well:\n\n```python\ndf.write.parquet('zones')\n```",

Replace `'YYYY-MM-DD'` with your actual date of interest.\n\n   ```python\n   specific_date = 'YYYY-MM-DD'  # replace with the desired date\n   filtered_df = spark.sql(f\"SELECT * FROM taxi_trips WHERE date_column = '{specific_date}'\")\n   ```\n\n   Make sure you replace `date_column` with the actual name of the date field present in your DataFrame.\n\n5. **Show Results**: Finally, you can display the filtered results.\n\n   ```python\n   filtered_df.show()\n   ```\n\nThese steps lay out how to filter taxi trip records by a specific date using SQL in PySpark.
