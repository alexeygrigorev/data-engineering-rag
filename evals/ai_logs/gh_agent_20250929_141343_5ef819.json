It covers the initialization of a Spark session, data loading, filtering, aggregation, and applying a machine learning model to predict trip durations.\n\n## Setting Up the Spark Session\n\nTo start working with PySpark, we first need to import the necessary libraries and set up a Spark session. The Spark session is the entry point for any Spark functionality.\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nIn this code block, we initialize a Spark session in a local environment, which allows us to process data using Spark features. The `master(\"local[*]\")` indicates that the application will use all available cores on the local machine.\n\n## Loading Data from Parquet Files\n\nNext, we load data from Parquet files into a PySpark DataFrame. The data contains green taxi trip records.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/green/*/*')\n```\n\nThe Parquet format is efficient for both storage and query performance. Loading the data into a DataFrame makes it easier to manipulate and analyze.\n\n## SQL Query for Data Aggregation\n\nWe can also perform SQL-like operations to aggregate data. The query below truncates the pickup datetime to the hour, groups by the hour and location, and calculates the total revenue and number of records.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    date_trunc('hour', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS hour, \n    PULocationID AS zone,\n    SUM(total_amount) AS amount,\n    COUNT(1) AS number_records\nFROM\n    green\nWHERE\n    lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2020-01-01 00:00:00'\nGROUP BY\n    1, 2\n```\n\nThis SQL statement calculates the total revenue and counts the number of trips during each hour for different pickup locations starting from January 1, 2020.\n\n## Working with RDDs\n\nAfter loading the data, we can convert a subset of the DataFrame into ",

              "content": "## Spark Setup\n\nIn this section, we set up the necessary environment and create a Spark session. This involves installing required packages and initializing Spark to handle data streams.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS'] = '--packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.3.1,org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.12:3.3.1 pyspark-shell'\n```\n\nIn the code block above, we specify the necessary packages for Spark SQL and Kafka integration. The `PYSPARK_SUBMIT_ARGS` environment variable is set to include these packages when launching PySpark.\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nimport pyspark.sql.types as T\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\n\nspark = SparkSession \\\n    .builder \\\n    .appName(\"Spark-Notebook\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nHere, we import essential modules from PySpark, create a new Spark session, and name it \"Spark-Notebook.\" This session will be used to interact with our streaming data throughout the notebook.\n\n## Reading from Kafka Stream\n\nThis section describes how to read data streams from Kafka. The data is retrieved using the `readStream` function.\n\n### 1.1 Raw Kafka Stream\n\nThe initial step in acquiring our data stream is connecting to the Kafka topic. In this example, we utilize the \"rides_csv\" topic.\n\n```python\n# default for startingOffsets is \"latest\"\ndf_kafka_raw = spark \\\n    .readStream \\\n    .format(\"kafka\") \\\n    .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"localhost:9092,broker:29092\") \\\n    .option(\"subscribe\", \"rides_csv\") \\\n    .option(\"startingOffsets\", \"earliest\") \\\n    .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"checkpoint\") \\\n    .load()\n```\n\nIn this code block, we set the Kafka bootstrap servers, specify the topic to subscribe to, and configure the starting offsets. The `checkpointLocation` is crucial for fault tolerance, ensuring the stream can be resumed in case of failures.\n\n```python\ndf_kafka_raw.printSchema()\n```\n\nThe `printSchema` method displays the structure of the DataFrame, allowing us to understand the nested stru",

The workflow includes reading data, performing SQL operations, and aggregating results for green and yellow taxis. \n\n## Setting Up the Spark Session\n\nBefore initiating any data processing, we need to set up a Spark session. This is the entry point to using Spark SQL.\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nIn the code above, we import the necessary libraries and initialize a `SparkSession`, which will manage the underlying Spark context. The `master(\"local[*]\")` parameter allows Spark to use all available cores on your local machine. `appName('test')` assigns a name to our application for identification.\n\n## Reading Green Taxi Data\n\nNext, we will read the green taxi data from Parquet files stored in the specified directory.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/green/*/*')\n```\n\nThis command reads all the Parquet files containing green taxi trip data into a DataFrame called `df_green`. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that is optimized for performance and compression.\n\n## Registering the Green Taxi Data Table\n\nTo perform SQL queries on our DataFrame, we need to register it as a temporary table.\n\n```python\ndf_green.registerTempTable('green')\n```\n\nHere, we register the `df_green` DataFrame as a temporary SQL table named `green`. This will allow us to run SQL queries against it easily.\n\n## Aggregating Revenue for Green Taxis\n\nNow we perform an SQL query to calculate the hourly revenue of green taxis.\n\n```python\ndf_green_revenue = spark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT \n    date_trunc('hour', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS hour, \n    PULocationID AS zone,\n    SUM(total_amount) AS amount,\n    COUNT(1) AS number_records\nFROM\n    green\nWHERE\n    lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2020-01-01 00:00:00'\nGROUP BY\n    1, 2\n\"\"\")",

It reads Parquet files containing trip data, standardizes the column names, combines the data, and performs aggregations to compute monthly revenue and other statistics. Finally, it saves the processed results into a BigQuery table.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **argparse**: This module provides a command-line argument parser.\n- **pyspark**: Used for handling big data processing with Apache Spark.\n- **SparkSession**: The entry point for reading data and creating DataFrame work.\n- **functions as F**: This is used to leverage Spark SQL functions conveniently.\n\n## Command-Line Arguments\n\nThe script requires three command-line arguments:\n- `--input_green`: Path to the input Parquet file for green taxi data.\n- `--input_yellow`: Path to the input Parquet file for yellow taxi data.\n- `--output`: Path to the output BigQuery table location for storing results.\n\n## Initializing Spark Session\n\nThe script initializes a Spark session named 'test'. A temporary bucket for GCP Dataproc is also set to handle intermediate files during execution. This ensures that Spark processes the data efficiently.\n\n```python\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\nspark.conf.set('temporaryGcsBucket', 'dataproc-temp-europe-west6-...')\n```\n\n## Reading and Preparing DataFrames\n\nGreen and yellow taxi data are read from Parquet files into separate DataFrames (`df_green` and `df_yellow`). The relevant datetime columns are renamed to provide a uniform schema.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet(input_green) \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n\ndf_yellow = spark.read.parquet(input_yellow) \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_d",
