The messages are expected to be in Avro format, utilizing schema information from a Schema Registry. The consumer processes both keys and values of the messages and prints them in a formatted manner. This is achieved through deserialization of the Avro messages, allowing structured access to the data within.\n\n## Dependencies\nThe script relies on several libraries:\n- **os**: For file path operations.\n- **typing**: For type hinting (used for `Dict` and `List`).\n- **confluent_kafka**: A Kafka client that supports Avro serialization and deserialization, including:\n  - `Consumer`: To consume messages from Kafka.\n  - `SchemaRegistryClient`: To interact with a Schema Registry.\n  - `AvroDeserializer`: To deserialize Avro messages.\n  - `SerializationContext`: To provide context during deserialization.\n  - `MessageField`: To distinguish keys and values during deserialization.\n  \nIt also imports helper functions from local modules to assist in transforming dictionary data formats: `dict_to_ride_record_key` and `dict_to_ride_record`. Configuration values are imported from a `settings` module.\n\n## Class: RideAvroConsumer\nThe `RideAvroConsumer` class is the main component of the script, encapsulating the logic required to consume messages from a Kafka topic.\n\n### `__init__` Method\nThe constructor accepts a dictionary of properties (`props`) that configure the consumer and deserialization process.\n\n1. **Schema Loading**: It loads schemas for keys and values using the `load_schema` method.\n2. **Schema Registry Configuration**: Initializes a `SchemaRegistryClient` using the provided URL.\n3. **Deserializer Initialization**: Sets up Avro deserializers for both message keys and values:\n   - The key serializer utilizes `dict_to_ride_record_key` for conversion from dictionary to a specific key format.\n   - The value serializer uses ",

It is designed to store sensitive information such as credentials that are crucial for connecting to external services like a Kafka cluster and a schema registry. This class provides a centralized place to define constants for these keys and secrets.\n\n## Class Structure\n\n### Constant Fields\n\nThe class contains four public static final fields, which are constants used to hold the key and secret for both Kafka and the schema registry. Each of these constants needs to be replaced with actual values before use. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the fields:\n\n1. **KAFKA_CLUSTER_KEY**\n   - Purpose: This constant is intended to store the key required to authenticate against a Kafka cluster.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KAFKA_CLUSTER_KEY\"` indicates that this placeholder should be replaced with the actual Kafka cluster key at the time of implementation.\n\n2. **KAFKA_CLUSTER_SECRET**\n   - Purpose: This constant is designed to hold the secret associated with the Kafka cluster key for authentication purposes.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KAFKA_CLUSTER_SECRET\"` also serves as a placeholder needing to be replaced with the actual Kafka cluster secret.\n\n3. **SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KEY**\n   - Purpose: This constant is used to store the key for accessing a schema registry, which is essential for managing schemas when using systems like Kafka.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KEY\"` is a reminder to substitute this with the actual schema registry key.\n\n4. **SCHEMA_REGISTRY_SECRET**\n   - Purpose: Similar to the above constants, this field stores the secret corresponding to the schema registry key for secure authentication.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_SECRET\"` emphasizes that the user must input an actual secret value.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- **Hardcoding Secrets**: It is important to note that hardcoding sensitive in",

Through the use of deserializers and a clean setup/configuration interface, it successfully abstracts the complexities involved in message handling and schema management, making it easier for developers to implement data streaming applications using Kafka and Avro serialization.",
