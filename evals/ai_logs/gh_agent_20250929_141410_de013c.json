The application consumes messages from a specified Kafka topic, processes these messages, and prints the contents to the console.\n\n## Components of the Application\n\n### Import Statements\n\n```python\nimport faust\nfrom taxi_rides import TaxiRide\n```\n\nThe code begins by importing the `faust` library, which is utilized for building asynchronous stream processing applications. It also imports the `TaxiRide` class from a local module called `taxi_rides`. This class is likely a data model representing the structure of a taxi ride record.\n\n### Application Initialization\n\n```python\napp = faust.App('datatalksclub.stream.v2', broker='kafka://localhost:9092')\n```\n\nAn instance of a Faust application is created using `faust.App()`. The application is named `'datatalksclub.stream.v2'` and is configured to connect to a Kafka broker running locally on port 9092. The Kafka broker is essential for managing the streaming data that the application will process.\n\n### Topic Definition\n\n```python\ntopic = app.topic('datatalkclub.yellow_taxi_ride.json', value_type=TaxiRide)\n```\n\nA topic is defined, which refers to a specific stream of data that the application will consume. In this case, the topic is `'datatalkclub.yellow_taxi_ride.json'`, and the messages expected in this topic are of the type `TaxiRide`. The `value_type` parameter indicates the data structure that will be used for deserialization of the incoming records.\n\n### Message Processing Agent\n\n```python\n@app.agent(topic)\nasync def start_reading(records):\n    async for record in records:\n        print(record)\n```\n\nThis section defines an asynchronous agent function called `start_reading`, which takes the records from the specified topic. The `@app.agent(topic)` decorator indicates that this function will automatically receive records from the Kafka topic.\n\nWithin the function, an asynchronous l",
