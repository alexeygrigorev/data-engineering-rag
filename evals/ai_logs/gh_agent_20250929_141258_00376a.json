It makes use of pandas for data manipulation, requests for HTTP operations, and the Google Cloud Storage client for uploading files.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore executing this script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n1. Install necessary Python packages:\n   ```\n   pip install pandas pyarrow google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n2. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to your project/service account key.\n\n3. Define the `GCP_GCS_BUCKET` environment variable to specify your GCS bucket. If not set, it will default to \"dtc-data-lake-bucketname\".\n\n## Constants and URL Setup\n\nThe script initializes a constant URL pointing to the GitHub repository where the NYC TLC data is hosted:\n```python\ninit_url = 'https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/'\n```\nAdditionally, it retrieves the name of the GCS bucket from the environment variable:\n```python\nBUCKET = os.environ.get(\"GCP_GCS_BUCKET\", \"dtc-data-lake-bucketname\")\n```\n\n## Function: upload_to_gcs\n\nThis function is responsible for uploading files to Google Cloud Storage.

This is necessary to comply with BigQuery's constraints on altering table structures to avoid errors.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this SQL script effectively creates two tables for tracking New York taxi trips (green and yellow), inserts additional data from a subsequent year, and standardizes their schemas by renaming various columns. This structured approach enables easier data processing and analysis of taxi ride statistics across both types of trips.",

          "content": "To modify the `web_to_gcs.py` script to load file types other than CSV, you would need to adjust certain sections of the code that are specifically dealing with CSV files. Here's a general outline of steps you might take:\n\n1. **Change URL Formation**: If your target files are not CSV, ensure that the file naming and URL formation reflect the new file type.\n\n2. **Adjust the File Downloading Logic**: The script currently uses `requests` to download CSV files. You may need to confirm that this logic can handle other formats correctly, or adjust it accordingly.\n\n3. **Modify Data Reading Logic**: \n   - The script currently reads CSV files using `pandas` with something like `pd.read_csv`. For other file formats, you'll need to change this line.\n   - For example, if you want to load JSON files, you would use `pd.read_json` instead. If it's Excel files, then use `pd.read_excel`.\n\n4. **Conversion Logic**: If your new file type needs to be transformed differently than CSV (e.g., if it's structured in a way that doesn't directly translate to a DataFrame), ensure that the conversion and saving into Parquet format is done correctly.\n\n5. **Upload Confirmation**: Ensure that the upload logic is still valid after your modifications to ensure that the files are uploaded correctly to GCS.\n\nHere is a very basic example of how you might alter the reading section from a CSV to JSON:\n\n```python\n# Original CSV reading\ndf = pd.read_csv(local_file_path)\n\n# Modified for JSON reading\ndf = pd.read_json(local_file_path)\n```\n\nMake sure to handle any additional parameters or configurations that your new file type may require.\n\n### References\nThe details regarding the `web_to_gcs.py` script and its logic can be found in the script documentation at the following link: \n[web_to_gcs.py](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-data-warehouse/extras/web_to_gcs.py).",
