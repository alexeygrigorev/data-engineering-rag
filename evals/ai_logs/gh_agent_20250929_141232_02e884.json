Handles both triggering & scheduled workflows, submits Tasks to the executor to run, monitors all tasks and DAGs, and\nthen triggers the task instances once their dependencies are complete.\n\n* **Worker**:\nThis component executes the tasks given by the scheduler.\n\n* **Metadata database (postgres)**:\nBackend to the Airflow environment. Used by the scheduler, executor and webserver to store state.\n\n* **Other components** (seen in docker-compose services):\n    * `redis`: Message broker that forwards messages from scheduler to worker.\n    * `flower`: The flower app for monitoring the environment. It is available at http://localhost:5555.\n    * `airflow-init`: initialization service (customized as per this design)\n\nAll these services allow you to run Airflow with CeleryExecutor. \nFor more information, see [Architecture Overview](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/overview.html).\n\n\n### Project Structure:\n\n* `./dags` - `DAG_FOLDER` for DAG files (use `./dags_local` for the local ingestion DAG)\n* `./logs` - contains logs from task execution and scheduler.\n* `./plugins` - for custom plugins\n\n\n### Workflow components\n\n* `DAG`: Directed acyclic graph, specifies the dependencies between a set of tasks with explicit execution order, and has a beginning as well as an end. (Hence, \u201cacyclic\u201d)\n    * `DAG Structure`: DAG Definition, Tasks (eg. Operators), Task Dependencies (control flow: `>>` or `<<` )\n    \n* `Task`: a defined unit of work (aka, operators in Airflow). The Tasks themselves describe what to do, be it fetching data, running analysis, triggering other systems, or more.\n    * Common Types: Operators (used in this workshop",

It is responsible for several important tasks:\n\n1. **Job Scheduling**: The scheduler is in charge of scheduling jobs within Airflow. It determines when tasks should be executed based on their configured execution times and dependencies.\n\n2. **Triggering Workflows**: It handles both triggered and scheduled workflows, ensuring that tasks are executed at the appropriate times.\n\n3. **Task Submission**: The scheduler submits tasks to the executor to run. This is how actual execution of tasks is initiated.\n\n4. **Monitoring**: It monitors all tasks and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), checking for task completion and dependencies. Once all dependencies of a task are satisfied, the scheduler triggers the task instances for execution.\n\nIn summary, the scheduler coordinates the workflow, ensuring tasks run in the correct sequence and at the right times, while interacting with other components like workers and the metadata database to maintain the overall functionality of Airflow.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Airflow architecture documentation: [Airflow Concepts and Architecture](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/docs/1_concepts.md).",
