              "content": "# PySpark Analysis of Taxi Trip Data\n\nThis document outlines a PySpark data analysis workflow using the `fhvhv_tripdata_2021-02.csv` dataset. The steps include initializing a Spark session, defining schemas, reading data, performing various queries, and extracting insights on taxi trips.\n\n## Setting Up Spark\n\nTo begin, we import the necessary PySpark libraries, which provide the tools needed to work with Spark data structures.\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.sql import types\n```\n\nNext, we initialize a `SparkSession`, which is the entry point for any PySpark application. By specifying the master node as local and naming the app \"test\", we can run this code locally.\n\n```python\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nVerifying the Spark version is important to ensure compatibility with the code we'll run.\n\n```python\nspark.version\n```\n\nLastly, we check that the required CSV file is present in the working directory.\n\n```python\n!ls -lh fhvhv_tripdata_2021-02.csv\n```\n\n## Defining the Data Schema\n\nBefore loading the data, we define the schema. This step specifies the structure of our dataset, ensuring that each column has the correct data type.\n\n```python\nschema = types.StructType([\n    types.StructField('hvfhs_license_num', types.StringType(), True),\n    types.StructField('dispatching_base_num', types.StringType(), True),\n    types.StructField('pickup_datetime', types.TimestampType(), True),\n    types.StructField('dropoff_datetime', types.TimestampType(), True),\n    types.StructField('PULocationID', types.IntegerType(), True),\n    types.StructField('DOLocationID', types.IntegerType(), True),\n    types.StructField('SR_Flag', types.StringType(), True)\n])\n```\n\n## Loading the Data\n\nAfter defining the schema, we read the CSV file into a DataFrame. This operation includes options to treat the first row as the header and apply the schema we just defined.\n\n```python\ndf = spa",
              "code": false,
              "filename": "05-batch/code/homework.ipynb"
            },

              "start": 4000,
              "content": ".sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT\n    to_date(pickup_datetime) AS pickup_date,\n    MAX((CAST(dropoff_datetime AS LONG) - CAST(pickup_datetime AS LONG)) / 60) AS duration\nFROM \n    fhvhv_2021_02\nGROUP BY\n    1\nORDER BY\n    2 DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\n## Dispatching Base Analysis\n\nIn order to find the most frequent `dispatching_base_num`, two methods are illustrated: using SQL and DataFrame operations. First, we run the SQL query.\n\n```python\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT\n    dispatching_base_num,\n    COUNT(1)\nFROM \n    fhvhv_2021_02\nGROUP BY\n    1\nORDER BY\n    2 DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\nSimilarly, we can utilize DataFrame operations to get the same top results based on `dispatching_base_num`.\n\n```python\ndf \\\n    .groupBy('dispatching_base_num') \\\n        .count() \\\n    .orderBy('count', ascending=False) \\\n    .limit(5) \\\n    .show()\n```\n\n## Most Common Locations Pair\n\nIn this section, we focus on identifying the most common pickup and drop-off location pairs. First, we load in the zones data.\n\n```python\ndf_zones = spark.read.parquet('zones')\n```\n\nWe check the columns of both the main dataset and zones dataset to understand the available fields.\n\n```python\ndf_zones.columns\n```\n\n```python\ndf.columns\n```\n\nNext, we register the zones DataFrame as a temporary table for SQL queries.\n\n```python\ndf_zones.registerTempTable('zones')\n```\n\nFinally, we run a SQL query to find the most common pick-up and drop-off location pairs.\n\n```python\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT\n    CONCAT(pul.Zone, ' / ', dol.Zone) AS pu_do_pair,\n    COUNT(1)\nFROM \n    fhvhv_2021_02 fhv LEFT JOIN zones pul ON fhv.PULocationID = pul.LocationID\n                      LEFT JOIN zones dol ON fhv.DOLocationID = dol.LocationID\nGROUP BY \n    1\nORDER BY\n    2 DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\nThrough these steps, we efficiently explored and analyzed the taxi trip data, providing insights into trip counts, durations, and popular locations.",

              "start": 3000,
              "content": "'fhvhv_2021_02')\n```\n\nThen, we execute a SQL query that counts the trips on the specified date.\n\n```python\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT\n    COUNT(1)\nFROM \n    fhvhv_2021_02\nWHERE\n    to_date(pickup_datetime) = '2021-02-15';\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\n## Longest Trip Analysis\n\nTo analyze the longest trip for each day, we need to calculate trip duration by subtracting `pickup_datetime` from `dropoff_datetime`.\n\n```python\ndf.columns\n```\n\nNext, we create a new column for duration, group the results by pickup date, and then find the maximum duration for each day.\n\n```python\ndf \\\n    .withColumn('duration', df.dropoff_datetime.cast('long') - df.pickup_datetime.cast('long')) \\\n    .withColumn('pickup_date', F.to_date(df.pickup_datetime)) \\\n    .groupBy('pickup_date') \\\n        .max('duration') \\\n    .orderBy('max(duration)', ascending=False) \\\n    .limit(5) \\\n    .show()\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can achieve the same analysis using an SQL query which provides flexibility for more complex queries.\n\n```python\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT\n    to_date(pickup_datetime) AS pickup_date,\n    MAX((CAST(dropoff_datetime AS LONG) - CAST(pickup_datetime AS LONG)) / 60) AS duration\nFROM \n    fhvhv_2021_02\nGROUP BY\n    1\nORDER BY\n    2 DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\n## Dispatching Base Analysis\n\nIn order to find the most frequent `dispatching_base_num`, two methods are illustrated: using SQL and DataFrame operations. First, we run the SQL query.\n\n```python\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT\n    dispatching_base_num,\n    COUNT(1)\nFROM \n    fhvhv_2021_02\nGROUP BY\n    1\nORDER BY\n    2 DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\nSimilarly, we can utilize DataFrame operations to get the same top results based on `dispatching_base_num`.\n\n```python\ndf \\\n    .groupBy('dispatching_base_num') \\\n        .count() \\\n    .orderBy('count', ascending=False) \\\n    .limit(5) \\\n    .show()\n```\n\n## Most Common Locations Pair\n\nIn this section, we focus on identifying the most common pickup and drop-off location pairs. First, we load in the zones data.\n\n```pytho",

First, we add a column for the pickup date and filter the DataFrame accordingly.\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\ndf \\\n    .withColumn('pickup_date', F.to_date(df.pickup_datetime)) \\\n    .filter(\"pickup_date = '2021-02-15'\") \\\n    .count()\n```\n\nIn addition, we can run an SQL query to obtain the same result. We start by registering a temporary table for SQL operations.\n\n```python\ndf.registerTempTable(",
              "code": false,
              "filename": "05-batch/code/homework.ipynb"

However, I can provide you with a general overview of IaC and its significance in modern cloud architectures.\n\n### What is Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)?\n\nInfrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is a key DevOps practice that involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. With IaC, the infrastructure is defined in code, enabling automated deployment and management.\n\n### Key Concepts of IaC:\n- **Declarative vs. Imperative**: IaC can be declarative (defining the desired state of the infrastructure) or imperative (defining the commands to create that infrastructure).\n- **Version Control**: IaC configurations can be stored in version control systems, allowing teams to track changes over time.\n- **Automation**: IaC enables automated provisioning of infrastructure, which reduces the chances of human error and speeds up deployment processes.\n\n### Significance of IaC in Modern Cloud Architectures:\n\n1. **Consistency**: IaC reduces discrepancies between development, testing, and production environments by ensuring that all environments are set up in an automated and repeatable manner.\n\n2. **Speed**: Automated deployment and configurations allow teams to provision infrastructure quickly and efficiently, enabling agile development practices and rapid delivery of features.\n\n3. **Cost Management**: With IaC, it becomes easier to use cloud resources efficiently, as infrastructure can be automatically scaled up or down based on demand, which helps to optimize costs.\n\n4. **Collaboration and Scalability**: Teams can collaborate more effectively as they can share code for infrastructure setups. This is particularly useful in larger systems where infrastructure complexity can be significant.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**: IaC allows for testing infrastructure before deployment using tools that can validate the code against best practices and compliance standards, leading to more reliable infrastructure deployments.\n\nIn conclusion, Infrastructure-as-Code is a fundamental practice for modern cloud architectures that enhances consistency, speed, cost-effectiveness, and collaboration, making it an essential tool for any cloud infrastructure team.\n\nIf you need further detailed materials or references, feel free to ask!",
