              "content": "# Data Ingestion DAG for Google Cloud Storage\n\nThis document provides a high-level description of a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) implemented using Apache Airflow for ingesting a dataset containing yellow taxi trip data from New York City into Google Cloud Storage (GCS). The DAG includes tasks for downloading the dataset from a remote URL and uploading it to a specified GCS bucket.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe DAG is designed to run daily (`@daily`), ensuring that it fetches the most up-to-date dataset each day. It orchestrates two main tasks:\n\n1. **Downloading the Dataset**: Retrieves a CSV file containing trip data.\n2. **Uploading to Google Cloud Storage**: Transfers the downloaded file to a specified GCS bucket.\n\nThe workflow is structured to ensure that the upload task only begins after the download task completes successfully. This is indicated by the task dependency defined at the end of the DAG.\n\n## Environment Configuration\n\nThe script starts by importing necessary modules, including:\n\n- `os`: For accessing environment variables.\n- `datetime`: To handle date-related operations.\n- `airflow`: The core libraries for creating and managing the DAG.\n- `google.cloud.storage`: For interacting with Google Cloud Storage.\n\nSeveral environment variables are retrieved, allowing for configuration flexibility without hardcoding values. These include:\n\n- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The Google Cloud project ID (default value set).\n- `GCP_GCS_BUCKET`: The name of the GCS bucket for uploading the data.\n- `AIRFLOW_HOME`: The directory for Airflow home settings.\n\nA URL for the dataset and a local file path for downloads are constructed using these environment variables.\n\n## DAG Definition\n\nA `DAG` instance is created with specific configurations:\n\n- **dag_id**: Unique identifier for the DAG (`data_ingestion_gcs_dag`).\n- **schedule_interval**: Set to run daily.\n- **default_args**: Includes common parameters like the owner, start date, and retry settings.\n- **catchup**: Allows the DAG to run for past d",

This operator executes a shell command to download the dataset. \n\n- **task_id**: `download_dataset_task`\n- **bash_command**: Utilizes `curl` to silently fetch the dataset from a specified URL and saves it locally.\n\nThe task execution time is estimated to be around 2 minutes, depending on the download speed of the executing machine.\n\n## Task 2: Uploading to Google Cloud Storage\n\n### `upload_to_gcs_task`\n\nThe second task is also defined using the `BashOperator`. This command uploads the previously downloaded dataset to GCS while handling authentication:\n\n- **task_id**: `upload_to_gcs_task`\n- **bash_command**: \n  - Activates a Google Cloud service account using a key file located at `path_to_creds`.\n  - Uses `gsutil` to copy the local CSV file to the specified GCS buc",

Kick up the all the services from the container (no need to specially initialize):\n    ```shell\n    docker-compose -f docker-compose-nofrills.yml up\n    ```\n\n  4. In another terminal, run `docker ps` to see which containers are up & running (there should be 3, matching with the services in your docker-compose file).\n\n  5. Login to Airflow web UI on `localhost:8080` with creds: `admin/admin` (explicit creation of admin user was required)\n\n  6. Run your DAG on the Web Console.\n\n  7. On finishing your run or to shut down the container/s:\n    ```shell\n    docker-compose down\n    ```\n    \n### Setup - Taken from DE Zoomcamp 2.3.4 - Optional: Lightweight Local Setup for Airflow\n\nUse the docker-compose_2.3.4.yaml file (and rename it to docker-compose.yaml). Don't forget to replace the variables `GCP_PROJECT_ID` and `GCP_GCS_BUCKET`.\n\n### Future Enhancements\n* Deploy self-hosted Airflow setup on Kubernetes cluster, or use a Managed Airflow (Cloud Composer) service by GCP\n\n### References\nFor more info, check out these official docs:\n   * https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/docker.html\n   * https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html\n   * https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/recipes.html",

          "content": "Apache Airflow handles task dependencies within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using explicit links between tasks to define execution orders. Here's a breakdown of how dependencies are managed:\n\n1. **DAG Structure**: A DAG in Airflow is essentially a collection of tasks that describe a workflow, along with defined dependencies. The DAG structure specifies tasks and their relationships, which dictate the flow of execution. \n\n2. **Task Dependencies**: Task dependencies are defined using the shift operators:\n   - The `>>` operator sets a downstream dependency, meaning the task on the left must complete successfully before the task on the right can run.\n   - The `<<` operator sets an upstream dependency, which is the opposite.\n\n   For example, if you have two tasks, `task_a` and `task_b`, you can define their relationship like this:\n   ```python\n   task_a >> task_b  # task_b will run after task_a completes successfully\n   ```\n\n3. **Execution Order**: In the DAG definition, you can explicitly state the order in which tasks should be executed. The scheduler in Airflow monitors these dependencies and triggers task execution accordingly, ensuring that downstream tasks wait for their upstream counterparts to finish.\n\n4. **Task Instances**: Each task defined in the DAG can have different instances that represent individual executions. The state of each task instance (e.g., running, success, failed) is tracked within the Airflow system, facilitating dependency management.\n\nThis design ensures that workflows are executed in a controlled and predictable manner, avoiding any cyclic dependencies while maintaining an acyclic structure.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the official [Apache Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html) or check the course material documentation: [Airflow Concepts](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/docs/1_concepts.md).",
