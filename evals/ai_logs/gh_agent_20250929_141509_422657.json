This is because `host.docker.internal` works differently on Linux. Using the modified Docker Compose file below, you can run both Kestra and its dedicated Postgres DB, as well as the Post",

Hands-On Coding Project: Build Data Pipelines with Kestra\n\nThis week, we're gonna build ETL pipelines for Yellow and Green Taxi data from NYC\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). You will:\n1. Extract data from [CSV files](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases).\n2. Load it into Postgres or Google Cloud (GCS + BigQuery).\n3. Explore scheduling and backfilling workflows.\n\n>[!NOTE] \nIf you\u2019re using the PostgreSQL and PgAdmin docker setup from Module 1 for this week\u2019s Kestra Workflow Orchestration exercise, ensure your PostgreSQL image version is 15 or later (preferably the latest). The MERGE statement, introduced in PostgreSQL 15, won\u2019t work on earlier versions and will likely cause syntax errors in your kestra flows.\n\n### File Structure\n\nThe project is organized as follows:\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 flows/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 01_getting_started_data_pipeline.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02_postgres_taxi.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02_postgres_taxi_scheduled.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 03_postgres_dbt.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 04_gcp_kv.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 05_gcp_setup.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 06_gcp_taxi.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 06_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 07_gcp_dbt.yaml\n```\n\n### Setup Kestra\n\nWe'll set up Kestra using Docker Compose containing one container for the Kestra server and another for the Postgres database:\n\n```bash\ncd 02-workflow-orchestration/docker/combined\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nOnce the container starts, you can access the Kestra UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://loc",

ETL Pipelines in Kestra: Detailed Walkthrough\n\n### Getting Started Pipeline\n\nThis introductory flow is added just to demonstrate a simple data pipeline which extracts data via HTTP REST API, transforms that data in Python and then queries it using DuckDB. For this stage, a new separate Postgres database is created for the exercises. \n\n**Note:** Check that `pgAdmin` isn't running on the same ports as Kestra. If so, check out the [FAQ](#troubleshooting-tips) at the bottom of the README.\n\n### Videos\n\n- **2.2.3 - Create an ETL Pipeline with Postgres in Kestra**   \n  [![Create an ETL Pipeline with Postgres in Kestra](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FOkfLX28Ecjg%3Fsi%3DvKbIyWo1TtjpNnvt)](https://youtu.be/OkfLX28Ecjg?si=vKbIyWo1TtjpNnvt)\n- **2.2.4 - Manage Scheduling and Backfills using Postgres in Kestra**  \n  [![Manage Scheduling and Backfills using Postgres in Kestra](https://markdown-videos-api.jorgenkh.no/url?url=https%3A%2F%2",

              "start": 12000,
              "content": "_taxi.yaml`](flows/06_gcp_taxi.yaml).\n\n### GCP Workflow: Schedule and Backfill Full Dataset\n\nWe can now schedule the same pipeline shown above to run daily at 9 AM UTC for the green dataset and at 10 AM UTC for the yellow dataset. You can backfill historical data directly from the Kestra UI.\n\nSince we now process data in a cloud environment with infinitely scalable storage and compute, we can backfill the entire dataset for both the yellow and green taxi data without the risk of running out of resources on our local machine.\n\nThe flow code: [`06_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml`](flows/06_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml).\n\n### GCP Workflow: Orchestrate dbt Models (Optional)\n\nNow that we have raw data ingested into BigQuery, we can use dbt to transform that data. The flow will sync the dbt models from Git to Kestra and run the `dbt build` command to build the models:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Start[Select dbt command] --> Sync[Sync Namespace Files]\n  Sync --> Build[Run dbt Build Command]\n```\n\nThis gives you a quick showcase of dbt inside of Kestra so the homework tasks do not depend on it. The course will go into more detail of dbt in [Week 4](../04-analytics-engineering).\n\nThe flow code: [`07_gcp_dbt.yaml`](flows/07_gcp_dbt.yaml).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Bonus: Deploy to the Cloud (Optional)\n\nNow that we've got our ETL pipeline working both locally and in the cloud, we can deploy Kestra to the cloud so it can continue to orchestrate our ETL pipelines monthly with our configured schedules, We'll cover how you can install Kestra on Google Cloud in Production, and automatically sync and deploy your workflows from a Git repository.\n\nNote: When committing your workflows to Kestra, make sure your workflow doesn't contain any sensitive information. You can use [Secrets](https://go.kestra.io/de-zoomcamp/secret) and the [KV Store](https://go.kestra.io/de-zoomcamp/kv-store) to keep sensitive data out of your workflow logic.\n\n### Videos\n\n- **2.2.9 - Deploy Workflows to the Cloud with Git**   \n  [![Deploy Wor",

This is particularly useful in scenarios where flows may have missed execution due to outages or operational issues. With backfill, you can replay a scheduled flow for any given time in the past, ensuring that data processing remains consistent and complete.\n\nFor example, if a data pipeline scheduled to run daily at 9 AM missed execution one day, you can utilize Kestra's backfill feature to run that pipeline for the missed day without having to rerun it for the current day or adjust the schedule. This allows for the seamless integration of historical data into your systems.\n\nThe implementation of backfill in Kestra is designed to work smoothly with its scheduling capabilities, allowing users to manage both current and historical data workflows efficiently.\n\nFor more detailed information on setting up and using the backfill functionality, you may refer to the course materials available [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-workflow-orchestration/README.md).",
