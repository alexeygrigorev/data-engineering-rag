The model transforms raw trip data into a structured table for further analysis and reporting.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe model is designed to aggregate taxi trip data to analyze revenue trends by month and pickup zone. It retrieves data from a reference table, performs calculations on various revenue streams, and groups the results by revenue zone, revenue month, and service type.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe model is configured to be materialized as a table by the following line:\n\n```sql\n{{ config(materialized='table') }}\n```\n\nThis setting ensures that the output of this model is saved as a standalone table in the database, allowing for efficient querying of the aggregated results.\n\n## Data Source\n\nA Common Table Expression (CTE) named `trips_data` is defined to pull data from the reference table `fact_trips`. The base data comprises a wide range of fields related to taxi trips, including fare amounts, service types, pickup zones, and other relevant metrics.\n\n```sql\nwith trips_data as (\n    select * from {{ ref('fact_trips') }}\n)\n```\n\n## Revenue Metrics Calculation\n\nThe primary calculations in this model involve aggregating various revenue components for each revenue zone and month. The metrics calculated include:\n\n- **Revenue Grouping**:\n  - `pickup_zone` as `revenue_zone`: Represents the geographical area where passengers were picked up.\n  - `{{ dbt.date_trunc(\"month\", \"pickup_datetime\") }}` as `revenue_month`: Extracts the month from the pickup datetime to facilitate monthly aggregation.\n  - `service_type`: Specifies the type of service (e.g., standard ride, shared ride).\n\n- **Revenue Calculation**:\n  The following metrics are calculated as sums of individual components:\n  - `revenue_monthly_fare`: Total fare amounts for the month.\n  - `revenue_monthly_extra",

The use of external tables, partitioning, and clustering not only optimizes the performance of queries but also enhances data management practices for large-scale data analysis.",

          "content": "To perform a revenue analysis on the combined taxi datasets using SQL queries, you can follow these steps, which include aggregating and calculating the revenue metrics. Here's a general outline based on the information found in the course materials:\n\n1. **Data Sources**: You will typically derive your data from the tables containing taxi trip information. A reference table like `fact_trips` may contain necessary fields such as fare amounts, service types, and pickup zones.\n\n   ```sql\n   WITH trips_data AS (\n       SELECT * FROM {{ ref('fact_trips') }}\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. **Revenue Calculations**: You can calculate different revenue metrics, grouping them by location and time. Common metrics include total fares, number of rides, and possibly tips or additional charges. The following SQL snippet demonstrates how to extract these metrics:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT\n       pickup_zone AS revenue_zone,\n       DATE_TRUNC(pickup_datetime, MONTH) AS revenue_month,\n       service_type,\n       SUM(fare_amount) AS revenue_monthly_fare,\n       COUNT(*) AS total_rides\n   FROM trips_data\n   GROUP BY \n       pickup_zone, \n       revenue_month, \n       service_type\n   ORDER BY revenue_month, revenue_zone;\n   ```\n\n3. **Joining Different Taxi Data**: If you have separate datasets, for instance, for green and yellow cabs, you could combine the revenue data from both datasets. This involves renaming columns to prevent conflicts before joining them based on common fields such as `hour` and `zone`.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT\n       COALESCE(green_zone.revenue_zone, yellow_zone.revenue_zone) AS revenue_zone,\n       COALESCE(green_zone.revenue_month, yellow_zone.revenue_month) AS revenue_month,\n       coalesce(green_zone.revenue_monthly_fare, 0) AS green_revenue,\n       coalesce(yellow_zone.revenue_monthly_fare, 0) AS yellow_revenue\n   FROM\n       green_revenue AS green_zone\n       FULL OUTER JOIN yellow_revenue AS yellow_zone \n       ON green_zone.hour = yellow_zone.hour \n       AND green_zone.zone = yellow_zone.zone;\n   ```\n\n4. **Writing Results**: Once your revenue data is combined, you may want to save these results for further analysis.\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Pseudocode: The implementation depends on your environment\n   SAVE your_combined_data INTO 'your_output_location';\n   ```\n\n5. **Final Analysis**: To perform an analysis on the aggregated data, you can run queries that evaluate trends over time or performance metrics such as average fare per ride or revenue by service type.\n\nBe sure to replace the SQL terms with the actual field names and table schemas from your own database.\n\nFor further details and specifically structured queries, you can check the relevant models and examples in the repository, such as the monthly revenue analysis for taxi trips outlined in the [DBT Model Documentation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/core/dm_monthly_zone_revenue.sql) and the examples of combining data from different taxi types in the [SQL Course Content](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-data-warehouse/big_query.sql).",
