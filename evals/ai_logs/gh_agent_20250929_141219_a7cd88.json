It also enhances this dataset by incorporating geographical information about the pickup and dropoff locations through dimensional zone data.\n\n## Configuration\n\n```sql\n{{\n    config(\n        materialized='table'\n    )\n}}\n```\n\nThe script starts by configuring the output data to be materialized as a table. This means the final results of this query will be stored as a permanent table in the database, making them available for subsequent queries or analyses.\n\n## Data Ingestion\n\n### Green Trip Data\n\n```sql\nwith green_tripdata as (\n    select *, \n        'Green' as service_type\n    from {{ ref('stg_green_tripdata') }}\n)\n```\n\nThe first Common Table Expression (CTE) named `green_tripdata` retrieves records from the staging table for green trip data (`stg_green_tripdata`). It adds a new column `service_type`, marking all records as belonging to the `Green` service.\n\n### Yellow Trip Data\n\n```sql\nyellow_tripdata as (\n    select *, \n        'Yellow' as service_type\n    from {{ ref('stg_yellow_tripdata') }}\n)\n```\n\nSimilarly, the second CTE, `yellow_tripdata`, fetches records from the staging table for yellow trip data (`stg_yellow_tripdata`). Like the previous CTE, it adds a `service_type` column specifying this data belongs to the `Yellow` service.\n\n## Combining Trip Data\n\n```sql\ntrips_unioned as (\n    select * from green_tripdata\n    union all \n    select * from yellow_tripdata\n)\n```\n\nThe third CTE, `trips_unioned`, combines the data from both the `green_tripdata` and `yellow_tripdata` CTEs using the `UNION ALL` operator. This operation merges the two datasets into a single table while retaining all records, regardless of duplicates.\n\n## Filtering Dimensional Data\n\n```sql\ndim_zones as (\n    select * from {{ ref('dim_zones') }}\n    where borough != 'Unknown'\n)\n```\n\nNext, the `dim_zones` CTE retrieves zone dat",

This step ensures only valid geographical data is used for enriching the trip records.\n\n## Final Data Selection and Join\n\n```sql\nselect trips_unioned.tripid, \n    trips_unioned.vendorid, \n    ...\nfrom trips_unioned\ninner join dim_zones as pickup_zone\non trips_unioned.pickup_locationid = pickup_zone.locationid\ninner join dim_zones as dropoff_zone\non trips_unioned.dropoff_locationid = dropoff_zone.locationid\n```\n\nThe final output selects various attributes from the `trips_unioned` dataset, including trip IDs, vendor IDs, service types, location IDs, timestamps, and financial information related to the trips. It also performs inner joins with the `dim_zones` CTE twice: once to link the pickup location IDs to their respective borough and zone, and again for the dropoff location IDs.\n\n## Output Columns\n\nThe final output includes the following important columns:\n- **Trip Identifiers**: `tripid`,",

The materialization as a table allows for efficient subsequent querying and analysis. This data could be particularly useful for transportation analysis, business intelligence, or operational reporting purposes.",
