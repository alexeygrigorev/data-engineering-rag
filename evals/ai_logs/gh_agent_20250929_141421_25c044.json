It leverages the KafkaProducer from the Kafka library to facilitate message queueing and delivery. The provided settings such as bootstrap servers and input data path are fetched from external configuration files.\n\n## Imports\nThe script begins by importing necessary modules and classes:\n- `csv`: For reading data from CSV files.\n- `json`: For serializing ride data into JSON format.\n- `List`, `Dict`: For type hinting, improving clarity of function signatures.\n- `KafkaProducer`, `KafkaTimeoutError`: For creating a producer instance to send messages to a Kafka topic and handling potential timeout exceptions.\n- `Ride`: A custom class that is presumed to encapsulate the details of a ride record.\n- `settings`: External settings importing for configuration constants.\n\n## Class: JsonProducer\nThe `JsonProducer` class extends `KafkaProducer` and encapsulates functionality specific to producing JSON serialized data to Kafka:\n\n### Constructor: `__init__`\n```python\ndef __init__(self, props: Dict):\n    self.producer = KafkaProducer(**props)\n```\n- Initializes the Kafka producer with provided properties defined in a dictionary, allowing for flexible and adjustable configurations.\n\n### Static Method: `read_records`\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n```\n- Accepts a file path as input and reads ride records from a CSV file.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Opens the specified CSV file for reading.\n  - Uses the `csv.reader` to parse the file, skipping the header.\n  - For each row, it creates an instance of `Ride` initialized with the row data and collects them into a list.\n  \n### Method: `publish_rides`\n```python\ndef publish_rides(self, topic: str, messages: List[Ride]):\n```\n- Responsible for sending ride messages to a specified Kafka topic.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - I",

          "content": "To modify the Kafka producer script to send messages at a different rate, you typically need to adjust the sleep time between message sends. In the provided script, the sending rate is controlled by a `time.sleep()` call within the message-sending loop.\n\nFor example, in the provided snippet, the producer sleeps for 0.05 seconds between sending messages:\n\n```python\ntime.sleep(0.05)  # This controls the rate at which messages are sent.\n```\n\nTo change the rate at which messages are sent, you can increase or decrease this sleep time. Here\u2019s how it typically looks:\n\n1. **Increase the Sleep Time**: If you want to send messages more slowly (lower rate):\n   ```python\n   time.sleep(0.1)  # Increase sleep to 0.1 seconds\n   ```\n\n2. **Decrease the Sleep Time**: If you want to send messages faster (higher rate):\n   ```python\n   time.sleep(0.01)  # Decrease sleep to 0.01 seconds\n   ```\n\nHere's the relevant part from the message sending loop for clarity:\n```python\nfor i in range(10, 1000):\n    message = {'test_data': i, 'event_timestamp': time.time() * 1000}\n    producer.send(topic_name, value=message)\n    print(f\"Sent: {message}\")\n    time.sleep(0.05)  # Adjust this line to change the rate\n```\n\nIn summary, adjust the `time.sleep()` value according to the desired message sending rate. \n\nFor more detailed information about the Kafka producer script, you can refer to the documentation here: [Kafka Producer Script Documentation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/pyflink/src/producers/producer.py).",
