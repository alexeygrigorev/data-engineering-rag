We'll need\nto put these datasets to our data lake:\n\n* For the lessons, we'll need the Yellow taxi dataset (years 2019 and 2020)\n* For the homework, we'll need FHV Data (for-hire vehicles, for 2019 only)\n\nYou can find all the URLs on [the dataset page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)\n\n\nIn this homework, we will:\n\n* Modify the DAG we created during the lessons for transferring the yellow taxi data\n* Create a new dag for transferring the FHV data\n* Create another dag for the Zones data\n\n\nIf you don't have access to GCP, you can do that locally and ingest data to Postgres \ninstead. If you have access to GCP, you don't need to do it for local Postgres -\nonly if you want.\n\nAlso note that for this homework we don't need the last step - creating a table in GCP.\nAfter putting all the files to the datalake, we'll create the tables in Week 3.\n\n\n\n## Question 1: Start date for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)\n\nYou'll need to parametrize the DAG for processing the yellow taxi data that\nwe created in the videos. \n\nWhat should be the start date for this dag?\n\n* 2019-01-01\n* 2020-01-01\n* 2021-01-01\n* days_ago(1)\n\n\n## Question 2: Frequency for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)\n\nHow often do we need to run this DAG?\n\n* Daily\n* Monthly\n* Yearly\n* Once\n\n\n## Re-running the DAGs for past dates\n\nTo execute your DAG for past dates, try this:\n\n* First, delete your DAG from the web interface (the bin icon)\n* Set the `catchup` parameter to `True`\n* Be careful with running a lot of jobs in parallel - your system may not like it. Don't set it higher than 3: `max_active_runs=3`\n* Rename the DAG to something like `data_ingestion_gcs_dag_v02` \n* Execute it from the Airflow GUI (the play button)\n\n\nAlso, there's no data for the recent months, but `curl` will exit successfully.\nTo make it fail on 404, add the `-f` flag:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSLf { URL } > { LOCAL_PATH }\n```\n\nWhen you run this for all the da",

This is done by transforming it into a list of dictionaries.\n\n```python\nfrom time import time\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\n\nmessages = df.to_dict(orient='records')\nlen(messages)\n```\n\nThis section accomplishes the following:\n- We import `time` for potential timing functionalities and `tqdm` for progress visualization.\n- The Da",

The steps include data acquisition, preprocessing, and publishing the data to Kafka.\n\n## Setting Up the Kafka Producer\n\nTo start, we need to import the necessary libraries and set up our Kafka producer. The `json` library is used for converting data into a JSON format, and `kafka` provides functionalities for Kafka producers.\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom kafka import KafkaProducer\n\ndef json_serializer(data):\n    return json.dumps(data).encode('utf-8')\n\nserver = 'localhost:9092'\n\nproducer = KafkaProducer(\n    bootstrap_servers=[server],\n    value_serializer=json_serializer\n)\n\nproducer.bootstrap_connected()\n```\n\nIn this code block:\n- We define a `json_serializer` function that converts Python dictionaries into JSON formatted strings.\n- The server is specified as `localhost:9092`.\n- A Kafka producer is created with the server configuration and a JSON serializer to format the data for Kafka.\n\n## Downloading the NYC Taxi Data\n\nNext, we download the NYC taxi data from a GitHub repository.
