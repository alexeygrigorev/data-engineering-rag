It is designed to store sensitive information such as credentials that are crucial for connecting to external services like a Kafka cluster and a schema registry. This class provides a centralized place to define constants for these keys and secrets.\n\n## Class Structure\n\n### Constant Fields\n\nThe class contains four public static final fields, which are constants used to hold the key and secret for both Kafka and the schema registry. Each of these constants needs to be replaced with actual values before use. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the fields:\n\n1. **KAFKA_CLUSTER_KEY**\n   - Purpose: This constant is intended to store the key required to authenticate against a Kafka cluster.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KAFKA_CLUSTER_KEY\"` indicates that this placeholder should be replaced with the actual Kafka cluster key at the time of implementation.\n\n2. **KAFKA_CLUSTER_SECRET**\n   - Purpose: This constant is designed to hold the secret associated with the Kafka cluster key for authentication purposes.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KAFKA_CLUSTER_SECRET\"` also serves as a placeholder needing to be replaced with the actual Kafka cluster secret.\n\n3. **SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KEY**\n   - Purpose: This constant is used to store the key for accessing a schema registry, which is essential for managing schemas when using systems like Kafka.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_KEY\"` is a reminder to substitute this with the actual schema registry key.\n\n4. **SCHEMA_REGISTRY_SECRET**\n   - Purpose: Similar to the above constants, this field stores the secret corresponding to the schema registry key for secure authentication.\n   - Default Value: `\"REPLACE_WITH_SCHEMA_REGISTRY_SECRET\"` emphasizes that the user must input an actual secret value.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- **Hardcoding Secrets**: It is important to note that hardcoding sensitive in",

This approach increases the risk of exposing sensitive credentials when the code is shared or deployed. \n- **Best Practices**: It is recommended to utilize secure methods for managing and accessing these credentials, such as environment variables, configuration management tools, or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).\n\n### Integration\n\nDevelopers utilizing this class should replace the placeholder values with their actual credentials before deployment. The structure allows for easy integration with Kafka clients and schema management tools within the application that utilizes the `Secrets` class.\n\n### Consistency and Convention\n\nDefining the keys and secrets as `public static final` ensures they are constants that can be accessed without instantiating the class. This approach maintains consistency and clarity when referring to authentication credentials throughout the applicatio",
