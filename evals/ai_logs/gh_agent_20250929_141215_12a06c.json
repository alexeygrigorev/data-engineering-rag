Each record is created with attributes like `ID`, `Name`, `Age`, and `City`.\n\n### Tasks:\n\n1.

In this workshop, we will practice our data loading skills using best practices in data engineering. Below, you will find several exercises designed to enhance your understanding of generators, data loading with DuckDB, and merging datasets.\n\n## 1. Using Generators\n\nGenerators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to create iterators in a simple and efficient manner. In this exercise, we will define a generator that yields the square roots of numbers up to a specified limit.\n\n### Generator Definition and Usage\n\n```python\ndef square_root_generator(limit):\n    n = 1\n    while n <= limit:\n        yield n ** 0.5\n        n += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 5\ngenerator = square_root_generator(limit)\n\nfor sqrt_value in generator:\n    print(sqrt_value)\n```\n\nThe `square_root_generator` function takes a parameter `limit`, which determines how many square roots to yield. The `yield` statement allows this function to return a series of values, calculated as the square root of integers from 1 to `limit`. \n\n**Questions to Consider:**\n- **What is the sum of the outputs of the generator for `limit = 5`?**\n- **What is the 13th number yielded?**\n\nIt is recommended to attempt these questions independently to solidify your understanding.\n\n## 2. Appending a Generator to a Table with Existing Data\n\nIn this exercise, we will work with two separate generators representing groups of people. The goal is to load the data from both generators into a DuckDB table.\n\n### Loading and Appending Data\n\n```python\ndef people_1():\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        yield {\"ID\": i, \"Name\": f\"Person_{i}\", \"Age\": 25 + i, \"City\": \"City_A\"}\n\nfor person in people_1():\n    print(person)\n\n\ndef people_2():\n    for i in range(3, 9):\n        yield {\"ID\": i, \"Name\": f\"Person_{i}\", \"Age\": 30 + i, \"City\": \"City_B\", \"Occupation\": f\"Job_{i}\"}\n\nfor person in people_2():\n    print(person)\n```\n\nThe `people_1` generato",

This session will focus on best practices in data engineering, specifically leveraging generators to load and manipulate data using DuckDB. \n\n## Introduction to Generators\n\nIn this exercise, we will practice using Python generators\u2014an essential concept for efficient data processing. Generators allow for the lazy evaluation of data, yielding one item at a time and saving memory space. \n\n### Exercise 1: Using a Generator\n\nIn this section, we define a simple generator that yields the square roots of numbers from 1 up to a specified limit. Your tasks are to calculate the sum of these outputs for a limit of 5 and to find the 13th number yielded.\n\n**Code Example:**\n\n```python\ndef square_root_generator(limit):\n    n = 1\n    while n <= limit:\n        yield n ** 0.5\n        n += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nlimit = 5\ngenerator = square_root_generator(limit)\n\nfor sqrt_value in generator:\n    print(sqrt_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The function `square_root_generator()` takes a parameter `limit` and yields the square roots of integers from 1 to that limit.\n- A for-loop demonstrates how to iterate through the yielded values and print each square root.\n\n### Questions\n\n- **Question 1:** What is the sum of the outputs of the generator for limit = 5?\n- **Question 2:** What is the 13th number yielded?\n\nIt\u2019s encouraged to answer these questions with your own understanding to solidify the concept before consulting others.\n\n## Appending Data with Generators\n\nIn the next exercise, we\u2019ll work with two generators of people data.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Updated `people_1()` Generator\n\n```python\ndef people_1():\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        yield {\n            \"ID\": i,\n            \"Name\": f\"Person_{i}\",\n            \"Age\": 25 + i,\n            \"City\": \"City_A\",\n            \"Occupation\": f\"Job_{i}\"  # Added occupation field\n        }\n\n# Example Usage\nfor person in people_1():\n    print(person)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n1. **Inclusion of Occupation Field**: The added line `\"Occupation\": f\"Job_{i}\"` introduces an occupation field, simulating a job title for each person in the generator.\n   \n2. **Functionality**: This generator will now yield dictionaries that include not just the ID, Name, Age, and City, but also the new Occupation field.\n\nYou can find similar examples and context in the course materials.
