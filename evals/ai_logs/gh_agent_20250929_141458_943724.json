We'll need\nto put these datasets to our data lake:\n\n* For the lessons, we'll need the Yellow taxi dataset (years 2019 and 2020)\n* For the homework, we'll need FHV Data (for-hire vehicles, for 2019 only)\n\nYou can find all the URLs on [the dataset page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)\n\n\nIn this homework, we will:\n\n* Modify the DAG we created during the lessons for transferring the yellow taxi data\n* Create a new dag for transferring the FHV data\n* Create another dag for the Zones data\n\n\nIf you don't have access to GCP, you can do that locally and ingest data to Postgres \ninstead. If you have access to GCP, you don't need to do it for local Postgres -\nonly if you want.\n\nAlso note that for this homework we don't need the last step - creating a table in GCP.\nAfter putting all the files to the datalake, we'll create the tables in Week 3.\n\n\n\n## Question 1: Start date for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)\n\nYou'll need to parametrize the DAG for processing the yellow taxi data that\nwe created in the videos. \n\nWhat should be the start date for this dag?\n\n* 2019-01-01\n* 2020-01-01\n* 2021-01-01\n* days_ago(1)\n\n\n## Question 2: Frequency for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)\n\nHow often do we need to run this DAG?\n\n* Daily\n* Monthly\n* Yearly\n* Once\n\n\n## Re-running the DAGs for past dates\n\nTo execute your DAG for past dates, try this:\n\n* First, delete your DAG from the web interface (the bin icon)\n* Set the `catchup` parameter to `True`\n* Be careful with running a lot of jobs in parallel - your system may not like it. Don't set it higher than 3: `max_active_runs=3`\n* Rename the DAG to something like `data_ingestion_gcs_dag_v02` \n* Execute it from the Airflow GUI (the play button)\n\n\nAlso, there's no data for the recent months, but `curl` will exit successfully.\nTo make it fail on 404, add the `-f` flag:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSLf { URL } > { LOCAL_PATH }\n```\n\nWhen you run this for all the da",

Here\u2019s a general outline of the steps you would follow based on the available documentation:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Download the relevant taxi trip records for 2021 from the New York City Taxi Data website. Specifically, you'll want to gather the Yellow Taxi Trip Records for the specified months, if applicable.\n   - Ensure that you have access to the necessary file formats, and if you're required to use Parquet files, ensure those are selected.\n\n2. **Data Ingestion**:\n   - Depending on your environment (GCP, local, etc.), you may need to write a data ingestion script. You might be provided with a sample script, or you will need to create one that uploads the data files to your Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.\n   - Ensure you have properly configured permissions for your Service Account or have authenticated with the Google SDK.\n\n3. **BigQuery Setup**:\n   - Create an **External Table** in BigQuery using the downloaded taxi data. This will allow you to query the data without it being loaded into a regular table immediately.\n   - Optionally, create a **Materialized Table** or another type of regular table from the external data for more efficient query performance.\n\n4. **DAG Configuration** (if using orchestration tools like Airflow):\n   - Configure a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for your data pipeline to handle the data ingestion process.\n   - Consider setting the `catchup` parameter to `True`, so your DAG can execute for past dates. Be cautious with the `max_active_runs` parameter to avoid overwhelming your system.\n\n5. **Cleaning and Validating Data**:\n   - After ingestion, perform any necessary data cleaning and validation checks to ensure that the data quality meets the required standards.\n   - You might run queries to check the count of records or other specific attributes (e.g., fare amount validation).\n\n6. **Submission**:\n   - Ensure your code is included in a GitHub repository or another public code-hosting site as required by the assignment. Include any SQL queries or shell commands in your README.\n\nFor more detailed actions specific to your case, please check the module instructions or template provided in your course materials, as they may vary from assignment to assignment. \n\nFor additional information, you can refer to the homework assignment documentation [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/03-data-warehouse/homework.md).",
