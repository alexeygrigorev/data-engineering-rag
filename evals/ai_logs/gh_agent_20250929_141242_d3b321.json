              "content": "# Overview\n\nThis SQL script is part of a data transformation process using dbt (data build tool), which focuses on preparing taxi trip data for analysis. The goal of the script is to create a view containing structured and cleaned trip data by transforming the raw data from the staging area. The script achieves this through various SQL functions and casting techniques.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe script begins with a configuration block that specifies the materialization of the resulting data model. Here, the materialization is set to `'view'`, indicating that the output will be a view in the database. Views allow for simpler querying and can represent dynamic data sources.\n\n```sql\n{{\n    config(\n        materialized='view'\n    )\n}}\n```\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nNext, a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `tripdata` is created. This CTE selects all columns from a source table (`green_tripdata`) located in the `staging` schema. It adds a computed column (`rn`), which uses the `row_number()` function to assign a unique row number to each record, partitioning the data by `vendorid` and `lpep_pickup_datetime`. This step essentially allows the script to handle potential duplicate records efficiently.\n\n```sql\nwith tripdata as \n(\n  select *,\n    row_number() over(partition by vendorid, lpep_pickup_datetime) as rn\n  from {{ source('staging','green_tripdata') }}\n  where vendorid is not null \n)\n```\n\n## Selection of Key Fields\n\nFollowing the preparation of the `tripdata` CTE, the script selects various fields from it. The objective is to create a structured output that retains only necessary pieces of information relevant for analysis. \n\n### Identifiers\n\nThe query generates a surrogate key `tripid` by using the `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` function, which helps in uniquely identifying each trip. Additional identifiers such as `vendorid`, `ratecodeid`, `pulocationid`, and `dolocationid` are safely cast to integers.\n\n```sql\nselect\n    {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['vendorid'",

              "content": "# Overview\n\nThis script is a SQL-based Data Build Tool (dbt) model intended to transform yellow taxi trip data into a more analyzed and structured view. By processing the raw data from a source table, it aggregates, filters, and formats the information relevant to taxi trips, generating a view that can be reused for reporting and analysis.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe model is set to materialize as a view, which means that the resulting dataset will be generated and stored but not actually duplicated in the database. This materialization provides a dynamic result when queried, always reflecting the latest data available in the source.\n\n```sql\n{{ config(materialized='view') }}\n```\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nThe initial data preparation is encapsulated within a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `tripdata`. This CTE uses a `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to assign a sequential number to each row of trip data based on the `vendorid` and `tpep_pickup_datetime`. This is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent selection operates on unique trips and avoids redundant entries.\n\n```sql\nwith tripdata as \n(\n  select *,\n    row_number() over(partition by vendorid, tpep_pickup_datetime) as rn\n  from {{ source('staging','yellow_tripdata') }}\n  where vendorid is not null \n)\n```\n\nThis preparation also includes filtering out any records where `vendorid` is null, which ensures that only valid vendor entries are retained.\n\n## Selecting Trip Data\n\nThe main selection pulls various fields from the `tripdata` CTE, including identifiers, timestamps, trip information, and payment-related data. It uses utility functions provided by dbt to ensure proper data types and transformations.\n\n```sql\nselect\n   {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['vendorid', 'tpep_pickup_datetime']) }} as tripid,    \n   {{ dbt.safe_cast(\"vendorid\", api.Column.translate_type(\"integer\")) }} as vendorid,\n   ...\nfrom tripdata\nwhere rn = 1\n```\n\n### Identifiers\n\n1. **Trip ID**: A surrogate key is generated combining `vendorid` and `t",

This is useful for testing purposes, allowing developers to validate their logic without processing the entire dataset:\n\n```sql\n{% if var('is_test_run', default=true) %}\n  limit 100\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this dbt model effectively provides a transformed, structured view of yellow taxi trip data, making it suitable for analytical purposes. By leveraging window functions, casting to proper data types, and utility functions that enhance data integrity, it prepares the dataset for further analysis in a clear and concise manner. This model also prioritizes efficient performance during development through the conditional limit on result sets.",

When the variable `is_test_run` evaluates to true, it limits the output to a maximum of 100 records. This is useful for debugging or verifying the model without processing large volumes of data.\n\n```sql\n{% if var('is_test_run', default=true) %}\n  limit 100\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this SQL script is designed to cleanse and structure motor vehicle trip data for optimized analysis. By employing CTEs, data type casting, and selective field extraction, it prepares a comprehensive view while ensuring quality through filtering duplicate records and offering a mechanism for controlled test runs. The created view can subsequently serve as a reliable source for reporting or further analytics.",

The script includes operations for creating external tables, counting records, and creating new tables based on the external data.\n\n## Table Creation\n\n### External Table Definition\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\nThis part of the script creates or replaces an external table named `fhv_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny` project, specifically under the `nytaxi` dataset. The external table is defined to read CSV files stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The `uris` option points to all CSV files matching the pattern `fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv`, which includes all FHV trip data files for 2019. By using an external table, the content in the files can be queried directly without needing to load it into a regular database table.\n\n## Data Overview and Count\n\n### Total Records Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nThis query counts the total number of records present in the `fhv_tripdata` external table. This count can provide insights into the overall amount of trip data collected for the designated period.\n\n### Unique Dispatch Base Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dispatching_base_num)) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nHere, the script counts the number of distinct dispatching base numbers found in the `fhv_tripdata`. The dispatching base number is likely a unique identifier for the different taxi service providers. This query helps in understanding how many unique operators are present in the dataset.\n\n## Data Transformation\n\n### Non-Partitioned Table Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata`\nAS",

          "content": "To create a staging model for the FHV (for-hire vehicle) data and check the record count, you can follow these instructions based on the course materials:\n\n### Creating a Staging Model\n\n1. **Using dbt (Data Build Tool):**\n   You will need to create a new SQL file in your dbt project to define the staging model for your FHV data. The structure typically involves defining a Common Table Expression (CTE) and selecting the necessary fields.\n\n   Here is an example code snippet you can adapt for your `stg_fhv_tripdata.sql` file:\n\n   ```sql\n   {{ config(materialized='view') }}\n\n   with tripdata as (\n       select *,\n           row_number() over(partition by dispatching_base_num, pickup_datetime) as rn\n       from {{ source('staging', 'fhv_tripdata') }}\n       where dispatching_base_num is not null\n   )\n\n   select\n       {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['dispatching_base_num', 'pickup_datetime']) }} as tripid,\n       {{ dbt.safe_cast('dispatching_base_num', 'string') }} as dispatching_base_num,\n       cast(pickup_time as timestamp) as pickup_datetime,\n       cast(dropoff_time as timestamp) as dropoff_datetime,\n       -- Add other necessary fields here\n   from tripdata\n   where rn = 1\n   ```\n\n   This model selects records from the `staging` schema and generates a unique ID for each trip while filtering out duplicates.\n\n2. **Creating an External Table:**\n   If you haven\u2019t already, define an external table to read the FHV data stored in your cloud storage:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`\n   OPTIONS (\n       format = 'CSV',\n       uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv']\n   );\n   ```\n\n### Checking the Record Count\n\nTo check the record count in the FHV data, you can run the following SQL query against your external table or the newly created staging model:\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nIf your staging model is properly configured and materialized, you can also count the records directly from there:\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM {{ ref('stg_fhv_tripdata') }};\n```\n\n### Summary\n- Create a `stg_fhv_tripdata.sql` file to define your staging model.\n- Use SQL commands to create an external table for FHV data, if applicable.\n- Query the record count using `COUNT(*)` on the relevant table or model.\n\nFor more details, refer to the following files for structure and examples used in dbt modeling:\n- [Staging Green Trip Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/stg_green_tripdata.sql)\n- [Staging Yellow Trip Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/stg_yellow_tripdata.sql)\n\nFeel free to ask if you have more questions or need further clarification!",
