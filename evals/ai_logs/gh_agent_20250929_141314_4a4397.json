It encapsulates various attributes related to a taxi ride, such as the vendor ID, pickup and drop-off times, passenger count, trip distance, fare details, and more. This class can be used to create objects that represent individual rides, either from a list of attributes or from a dictionary.\n\n## Class Initialization\n\n### Constructor\n\nThe `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Ride` class. It takes a list of string attributes `arr` that contains all the necessary details for a ride. The attributes are parsed and assigned to instance variables, including:\n\n- **vendor_id**: A string indicative of the vendor providing the service.\n- **tpep_pickup_datetime**: The date and time when the ride was picked up, converted to a `datetime` object.\n- **tpep_dropoff_datetime**: The date and time of ride drop-off, also converted to a `datetime` object.\n- **passenger_count**: The number of passengers in the ride, converted to an integer.\n- **trip_distance**: The distance of the trip, represented as a `Decimal` for precision.\n- **rate_code_id**: An integer representing the rate code applied to the ride.\n- **store_and_fwd_flag**: A flag indicating whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n- **pu_location_id**: The pickup location ID, converted to an integer.\n- **do_location_id**: The drop-off location ID, converted to an integer.\n- **payment_type**: The method of payment used for the trip.\n- **fare_amount**: The base fare amount of the ride, represented as a `Decimal`.\n- **extra**: Any additional charges.\n- **mta_tax**: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax.\n- **tip_amount**: The tip amount provided by the rider.\n- **tolls_amount**: The amount charged for tolls during the trip.\n- **improvement_surcharge**: Charges related to improvements.\n- **total_amount**: The total amount charged for the ride.\n- **congestion_surcharge**: An additional charge related to congestion.",

Each element of the array corresponds to specific attributes of the ride. \n\n- The following parsing operations are performed within this constructor:\n  - Strings are converted into `LocalDateTime` objects for the pickup and drop-off times using a predefined date-time format.\n  - Other strings are parsed into their respective numeric types (int, long, or double) for attributes like passenger count, trip distance, and financial amounts.\n\n### Ride()\n\nThis is a default constructor that initializes a `Ride` object without setting any attributes. This constructor enables the ability to create empty `Ride` objects, which can later be populated with data if required.\n\n## Data Handling\n\nThe `Ride` class encapsulates data for the taxi ride, making use of Java's built-in data types:\n\n- **LocalDateTime** is utilized for accurately managing date and time information, ensuring that the ride timing is easy to manipulate and compare.\n- Primitive data types (int, long, double) are employed for various ride associated figures to optimize performance and memory usage.\n\nThe use of these types ensures that the attributes hold values that are meaningful, allowing for calculations (e.g., total fare), comparisons (e.g., pickup vs. drop-off time), and logical operations required in ride management applications.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis class can be utilized in applications that require management and analysis of taxi rides. For example, ride-hailing services can utilize instances of this class to track ride data, compute earnings, manage driver and vehicle statistics, and generate analytics for business ",
