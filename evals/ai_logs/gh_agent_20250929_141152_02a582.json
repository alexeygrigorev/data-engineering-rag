It leverages the KafkaProducer from the Kafka library to facilitate message queueing and delivery. The provided settings such as bootstrap servers and input data path are fetched from external configuration files.\n\n## Imports\nThe script begins by importing necessary modules and classes:\n- `csv`: For reading data from CSV files.\n- `json`: For serializing ride data into JSON format.\n- `List`, `Dict`: For type hinting, improving clarity of function signatures.\n- `KafkaProducer`, `KafkaTimeoutError`: For creating a producer instance to send messages to a Kafka topic and handling potential timeout exceptions.\n- `Ride`: A custom class that is presumed to encapsulate the details of a ride record.\n- `settings`: External settings importing for configuration constants.\n\n## Class: JsonProducer\nThe `JsonProducer` class extends `KafkaProducer` and encapsulates functionality specific to producing JSON serialized data to Kafka:\n\n### Constructor: `__init__`\n```python\ndef __init__(self, props: Dict):\n    self.producer = KafkaProducer(**props)\n```\n- Initializes the Kafka producer with provided properties defined in a dictionary, allowing for flexible and adjustable configurations.\n\n### Static Method: `read_records`\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n```\n- Accepts a file path as input and reads ride records from a CSV file.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Opens the specified CSV file for reading.\n  - Uses the `csv.reader` to parse the file, skipping the header.\n  - For each row, it creates an instance of `Ride` initialized with the row data and collects them into a list.\n  \n### Method: `publish_rides`\n```python\ndef publish_rides(self, topic: str, messages: List[Ride]):\n```\n- Responsible for sending ride messages to a specified Kafka topic.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - I",

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines alike.\n- This transformation is essential when preparing data for ingestion into a message broker like Kafka.\n\n### Kafka Publishing\n- After the data has been transformed into the necessary format, the next step would be to establish a connection to the Kafka broker as specified by the `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`.\n- The script would then create a producer instance that prepares to send messages to the Kafka topic defined by `KAFKA_TOPIC`.\n\n### Sending Messages\n- The script would loop over each entry (or ride) in the processed data and send each serialized JSON message to the Kafka topic. This allows for real-time processing and can facilitate further analysis or storage in systems designed to handle streaming data.\n\n### Error Handling and Logging\n- While not covered in the snippet, good practice in such scripts typically involves including error handling to manage issues related to data loading, transformation, and communication with Kafka.\n- Additionally, logging the success or failure of each operation is important for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, this code sets up the initial configurations needed to read ride data from a CSV file and send it to a Kafka topic after transforming it into the appropriate format. The constants defined indicate a focus on local development/testing, with an eye towards real-time data processing. This is a foundational step in constructing a data pipeline that could be expanded upon with additional functionality such as data validation, more complex transformations, or integration with other systems and services.",
