The workflow includes reading data, performing SQL operations, and aggregating results for green and yellow taxis. \n\n## Setting Up the Spark Session\n\nBefore initiating any data processing, we need to set up a Spark session. This is the entry point to using Spark SQL.\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nIn the code above, we import the necessary libraries and initialize a `SparkSession`, which will manage the underlying Spark context. The `master(\"local[*]\")` parameter allows Spark to use all available cores on your local machine. `appName('test')` assigns a name to our application for identification.\n\n## Reading Green Taxi Data\n\nNext, we will read the green taxi data from Parquet files stored in the specified directory.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/green/*/*')\n```\n\nThis command reads all the Parquet files containing green taxi trip data into a DataFrame called `df_green`. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that is optimized for performance and compression.\n\n## Registering the Green Taxi Data Table\n\nTo perform SQL queries on our DataFrame, we need to register it as a temporary table.\n\n```python\ndf_green.registerTempTable('green')\n```\n\nHere, we register the `df_green` DataFrame as a temporary SQL table named `green`. This will allow us to run SQL queries against it easily.\n\n## Aggregating Revenue for Green Taxis\n\nNow we perform an SQL query to calculate the hourly revenue of green taxis.\n\n```python\ndf_green_revenue = spark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT \n    date_trunc('hour', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS hour, \n    PULocationID AS zone,\n    SUM(total_amount) AS amount,\n    COUNT(1) AS number_records\nFROM\n    green\nWHERE\n    lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2020-01-01 00:00:00'\nGROUP BY\n    1, 2\n\"\"\")",
              "code": false,

            },
            {
              "start": 1000,
              "content": "y.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/green/*/*')\n```\n\nThis command reads all the Parquet files containing green taxi trip data into a DataFrame called `df_green`. Parquet is a columnar storage file format that is optimized for performance and compression.\n\n## Registering the Green Taxi Data Table\n\nTo perform SQL queries on our DataFrame, we need to register it as a temporary table.\n\n```python\ndf_green.registerTempTable('green')\n```\n\nHere, we register the `df_green` DataFrame as a temporary SQL table named `green`. This will allow us to run SQL queries against it easily.\n\n## Aggregating Revenue for Green Taxis\n\nNow we perform an SQL query to calculate the hourly revenue of green taxis.\n\n```python\ndf_green_revenue = spark.sql(\"\"\"\nSELECT \n    date_trunc('hour', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS hour, \n    PULocationID AS zone,\n    SUM(total_amount) AS amount,\n    COUNT(1) AS number_records\nFROM\n    green\nWHERE\n    lpep_pickup_datetime >= '2020-01-01 00:00:00'\nGROUP BY\n    1, 2\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nIn this SQL operation, we:\n- Truncate the pickup datetime to the hour level.\n- Group the results by hour and pick-up zone.\n- Calculate total revenue (`SUM(total_amount)`) and the count of records for each group.\n- Filter the records to include only those from the year 2020 onwards.\n\n## Writing Green Taxi Revenue Data to Disk\n\nAfter aggregating the data, we write the results to a new Parquet file.\n\n```python\ndf_green_revenue \\\n    .repartition(20) \\\n    .write.parquet('data/report/revenue/green', mode='overwrite')\n```\n\nHere, we use `repartition(20)` to optimize the data distribution across 20 partitions for better parallelism when writing to disk. The results are stored in the specified directory, overwriting any existing data.\n\n## Reading Yellow Taxi Data\n\nWe will repeat the earlier steps for yellow taxi data.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/yellow/*/*')\ndf_yellow.registerTempTable('yellow')\n```\n\nSimilar to the green taxi data, we read the yellow taxi trip data",
              "code": false,
              "filename": "05-batch/code/07_groupby_join.ipynb"

              "start": 2000,
              "content": " will also load the yellow taxi data using the same methodology to maintain consistency in our dataset shapes.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/yellow/*/*')\n```\n\nThis line reads all yellow taxi data from the specified Parquet files into a DataFrame called `df_yellow`.\n\n## Renaming Columns in Yellow Taxi Data\n\nAs with the green taxi data, we need to rename the columns in the yellow taxi DataFrame to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow = df_yellow \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n```\n\nWe rename the datetime columns in the yellow taxi DataFrame to match the green taxi DataFrame, utilizing the same standardized naming convention.\n\n## Identifying Common Columns\n\nBefore combining the two datasets, we should identify the common columns they share. This process helps us ensure that the merged DataFrame will contain consistent columns.\n\n```python\ncommon_colums = []\n\nyellow_columns = set(df_yellow.columns)\n\nfor col in df_green.columns:\n    if col in yellow_columns:\n        common_colums.append(col)\n```\n\nIn this code block, we create a list of common columns by comparing the columns from both DataFrames. The `common_colums` list will be used for further selections in our analysis.\n\n## Preparing Selected Data for Green Taxis\n\nNow that we have the common columns, we will create a new DataFrame that only includes these columns from the green taxi dataset and add a new column to specify the service type.\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as F\n\ndf_green_sel = df_green \\\n    .select(common_colums) \\\n    .withColumn('service_type', F.lit('green'))\n```\n\nWe select only the common columns and add a new column `service_type`, which indicates that these entries originate from the green taxi dataset.\n\n## Preparing Selected Data for Yellow Taxis\n\nFollowing the same approach for the yellow taxi dataset, we will create a similar DataFrame.\n\n```python\ndf_ye",
