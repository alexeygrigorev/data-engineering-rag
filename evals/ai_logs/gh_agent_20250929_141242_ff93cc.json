Pre-requisites\n\nIf you have been following the [module-06](./../../../06-streaming/README.md) videos, you might already have installed the `kafka-python` library, so you can move on to [Docker](#2-docker) section.\n\nIf you have not, this is the only package you need to install in your virtual environment for this Redpanda lesson. \n\n1. activate your environment\n2. `pip install kafka-python`\n\n## 2. Docker\n\nStart a Redpanda cluster. Redpanda is a single binary image, so it is very easy to start learning kafka concepts with Redpanda.\n\n```bash\ncd 06-streaming/python/redpanda_example/\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n## 3. Set RPK alias\n\nRedpanda has a console command `rpk` which means `Redpanda keeper`, the CLI tool that ships with Redpanda and is already available in the Docker image. \n\nSet the following `rpk` alias so we can use it from our terminal, without having to open a Docker interactive terminal. We can use this `rpk` alias directly in our terminal. \n\n```bash\nalias rpk=\"docker exec -ti redpanda-1 rpk\"\nrpk version\n```\n\nAt this time, the verion is shown as `v23.2.26 (rev 328d83a06e)`.

It includes examples of how to create a database connection, execute SQL queries, and load CSV data into the database.\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\nTo start, you'll need to install some essential packages. The following command installs SQLAlchemy and psycopg2-binary, which are required for database connectivity with PostgreSQL.\n\n```bash\npip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary \n```\n\n### Importing Necessary Libraries\n\nAfter installing the required packages, you should import the necessary libraries into your Python script. In this case, we are using the Pandas library for data manipulation and SQLAlchemy to manage the database connections.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n\n## Creating a Database Connection\n\nTo connect to a PostgreSQL database, you can use SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` function. This function constructs a connection string that specifies the database type, user credentials, host, and database name.\n\n```python\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')\n```\n\n### Verifying the Connection\n\nOnce you have created the engine, it's good practice to verify that the connection is successful. This can be done by calling the `connect()` method on the engine object.\n\n```python\nengine.connect()\n```\n\n## Executing Simple SQL Queries\n\nWith an established connection, you can execute SQL queries. \n\n### Example Query: Simple SELECT\n\nThe following SQL query selects a constant value and returns it. It serves as a simple test to check if the database is operational.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSELECT 1 as number;\n\"\"\"\n\npd.read_sql(query, con=engine)\n```\n\n### Querying Database Tables\n\nYou can query the existing tables in your database. The next block retrieves all user-defined tables, excluding system tables.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSEL",

Kafka Producer - Consumer Examples\n\nTo run the producer-consumer examples, open 2 shell terminals in 2 side-by-side tabs and run following commands. Be sure to activate your virtual environment in each terminal.\n\n```bash\n# Start consumer script, in 1st terminal tab\npython -m consumer.py\n# Start producer script, in 2nd terminal tab\npython -m producer.py\n```\n\nRun the `python -m producer.py` command again (and again) to observe that the `consumer` worker tab would automatically consume messages in real-time when new `events` occur\n\n## 5.

          "content": "To set up a connection to a PostgreSQL database using Python, you can utilize the SQLAlchemy library for effective database interaction. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: First, you need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already. You'll need both `sqlalchemy` and `psycopg2-binary`.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary\n   ```\n\n2. **Import Libraries**: In your Python script, import the libraries you need.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a Database Connection**: Use the `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy to create a connection. The connection string specifies the database type, user credentials, host, and database name.\n\n   ```python\n   engine = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name')\n   ```\n\n   Replace `username`, `password`, and `database_name` with your actual credentials and database name.\n\n4. **Verify the Connection**: You can verify that your connection is successful by using the `connect()` method to attempt a connection.\n\n   ```python\n   with engine.connect() as connection:\n       print(\"Connection successful!\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Executing SQL Queries**: Once the connection is established, you can execute SQL queries. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   query = \"SELECT 1 as number;\"\n   result = pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\nThis approach uses Python and SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database and allows you to run SQL commands easily.\n\nFor more detailed information and examples involving database interactions and data loading, please refer to the specific document on PostgreSQL database interaction from the course materials: [PostgreSQL Database Interaction and Data Loading](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-docker-terraform/2_docker_sql/pg-test-connection.ipynb).",
