The script includes operations for creating external tables, counting records, and creating new tables based on the external data.\n\n## Table Creation\n\n### External Table Definition\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\nThis part of the script creates or replaces an external table named `fhv_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny` project, specifically under the `nytaxi` dataset. The external table is defined to read CSV files stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The `uris` option points to all CSV files matching the pattern `fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv`, which includes all FHV trip data files for 2019. By using an external table, the content in the files can be queried directly without needing to load it into a regular database table.\n\n## Data Overview and Count\n\n### Total Records Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nThis query counts the total number of records present in the `fhv_tripdata` external table. This count can provide insights into the overall amount of trip data collected for the designated period.\n\n### Unique Dispatch Base Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dispatching_base_num)) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nHere, the script counts the number of distinct dispatching base numbers found in the `fhv_tripdata`. The dispatching base number is likely a unique identifier for the different taxi service providers. This query helps in understanding how many unique operators are present in the dataset.\n\n## Data Transformation\n\n### Non-Partitioned Table Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata`\nAS",

This includes checking metadata, converting the file to a Pandas DataFrame, generating SQL statements, establishing a database connection, and finally inserting the data into the database. We'll also cover handling both CSV and Parquet files for flexibility.\n\n## Initial Setup \n\nTo begin, we first import the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `SQLAlchemy`. These libraries will facilitate reading the Parquet file, manipulating data, and connecting to the SQL database.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd \nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\nfrom time import time\n```\n\n## Reading Metadata from the Parquet File\n\nNext, we will read the metadata from the specified Parquet file. This step helps us understand the structure and schema of the data without loading it entirely into memory.\n\n```python\n# Read metadata \npq.read_metadata('yellow_tripdata_2023-09.parquet')\n```\n\n## Reading Data and Schema Check\n\nWe will now read the full Parquet file and check its schema. Understanding the schema ensures that we know the data types and structure before converting the data to a Pandas DataFrame.\n\n```python\n# Read file, read the table from file and check schema\nfile = pq.ParquetFile('yellow_tripdata_2023-09.parquet')\ntable = file.read()\ntable.schema\n```\n\n## Converting to Pandas DataFrame\n\nAfter reading the data, we will convert the table into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows us to utilize Pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities, including checking the DataFrame's information and data types.\n\n```python\n# Convert to pandas and check data \ndf = table.to_pandas()\ndf.info()\n```\n\n## Establishing Database Connection\n\nBefore proceeding with inserting data, we need to establish a connection to our PostgreSQL database. This connection will allow us to execute SQL commands directly from Python.\n\n```python\n# Create an open SQL database connection object or a SQLAlchemy connectabl",

The table is created with the name specified by the `tb` parameter, and if it already exists, it will be replaced.\n\n## Data Insertion\n\n```python\nt_start = time()\ncount = 0\nfor batch in df_iter:\n    count+=1\n\n    if '.parquet' in file_name:\n        batch_df = batch.to_pandas()\n    else:\n        batch_df = batch\n\n    print(f'inserting batch {count}...')\n\n    b_start = time()\n    batch_df.to_sql(name=tb, con=engine, if_exists='append')\n    b_end = time()\n\n    print(f'inserted! time taken {b_end-b_start:10.3f} seconds.\\n')\nt_end = time()   \nprint(f'Completed! Total time taken was {t_end-t_start:10.3f} seconds for {count} batches.')\n```\n\nIn the data insertion phase, the script measures the total time required and tracks the number of batches inserted. For each batch, the DataFrame is converted to a pandas DataFrame (if necessary) and then appended to the PostgreSQL table using the `.to_sql()` function. During each insertion, the script logs the time taken to complete that specific batch, providing a clear picture of performance.\n\n## Final Output\n\nUpon completion, the script prints a summary of the total time taken for all batches to be inserted, giving the user feedback on the overall efficiency of the data-loading process.\n\nIn summary, this script automates the entire workflow of downloading data from web sources and loading it into a PostgreSQL database, making it a valuable tool for data engineers and analysts.",

This allows for validation of the schema before actually inserting the data.\n\n```python\n# Generate CREATE SQL statement from schema for validation\nprint(pd.io.sql.get_schema(df, name='yellow_taxi_data', con=engine))\n```\n\n## Inserting Data into Database\n\nWith the connection established and schema validated, we can now focus on inserting the data into the PostgreSQL database. The dataset contains 2,846,722 rows, so we'll process the file in batches of 100,000 rows using the `iter_batches` function. This method is efficient and prevents memory overload.\n\n```python\n# Creating batches of 100,000 for the parquet file\nbatches_iter = file.iter_batches(batch_size=100000)\nbatches_iter\n\n# Take the first batch for te",

It uses the `argparse` module to capture various command-line arguments. These include:\n\n- `user`: Username for authenticating with the PostgreSQL database.\n",

          "content": "To create an external table using the FHV 2019 data, you can use the following SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\nThis statement creates an external table named `fhv_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny` project within the `nytaxi` dataset. The table is designed to read CSV files stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket based on the specified URI pattern (matching all FHV trip data files for 2019) without loading the data into a regular database table. \n\n### Tips for Loading the Table:\n1. **File Format**: Make sure you specify the correct file format when creating the external table. In this case, we are using 'CSV' as shown above.\n2. **Check Files in the Bucket**: Before querying the external table, ensure that all the expected files are present in the specified GCS bucket.\n3. **Avoid Mixing Formats**: If you are planning to swap between CSV and Parquet formats, ensure that you specify the correct options and validate that the files match the chosen format type.\n\n### What to Avoid When Loading Data:\n- **Do Not Use Incorrect File Types**: When creating an external table, ensure that the files in the GCS match the declared format (CSV in this case). This will prevent errors during the querying phase.\n- **Avoid Loading Large Data Without Validation**: Before running queries, it's advisable to validate the schema and contents of the external files to avoid running into unexpected issues.\n- **Avoid Partitions**: When creating external tables with certain formats such as CSV, be cautious with expectations around partitioning and clustering that typically apply to regular tables.\n\nFor further information, you can refer to the complete documentation in the following sources:\n\n1.
