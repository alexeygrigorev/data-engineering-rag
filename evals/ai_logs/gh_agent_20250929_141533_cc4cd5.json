This can be useful for validating instances or for debugging.\n\n### Encoder and Decoder Retrieval\n\nStatic methods `getEncoder()` and `getDecoder()` allow access to the instance of `BinaryMessageEncoder` and `BinaryMessageDecoder`, respectively, being utilized by the `RideRecord`. This centralized management simplifies encoding and decoding operations across possibly multiple instances of `RideRecord`.\n\n## Exception Handling\n\nThroughout its methods, the class handles various I/O exceptions (specifically `java.io.IOException`). Care is taken to check for potential issues during serialization and deserialization. If any problems arise, they result in an IOException or an Avro runtime exception. \n\n## Conclusion \n\nThe `RideRecord` class effectively encapsulates data related to ride-sharing records, providing both simplicity in user access through getter/setter methods and advanced features such as serialization, deserialization, and a builder pattern for instance creation. The design benefits from Avro's capabilities for efficient data encoding and schema evolution while managing the intricacies of data representation in a clear and maintainable way.",

This indicates that it anticipates the possibility of thread interruptions during operations like sleeping or checking the application state.\n\nHere's how exceptions are handled:\n\n1. **Declared Exceptions**: The method declares `InterruptedException`, which means any calling code needs to deal with this exception. This allows for better thread management in the application, ensuring that any interruptions can be handled gracefully by the invoking methods.\n  \n2. **State Monitoring**: The method contains a loop that checks the state of the Kafka Streams application until it becomes `RUNNING`. If an interruption occurs during this checking process (due to a `sleep` method, for example), it can throw the `InterruptedException`, which must be caught or propagated upwards.\n\n3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Additionally, a shutdown hook is registered to ensure that the Kafka Streams application closes gracefully when terminated. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of data processing and ensuring resources are freed properly.\n\nIn summary, `countPLocation()` relies on the exception mechanism to manage potential interruptions, and it requires that the methods calling it handle these exceptions appropriately, thus contributing to the stability of the application.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the source in the repository: [JsonKStream.java](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonKStream.java).",
