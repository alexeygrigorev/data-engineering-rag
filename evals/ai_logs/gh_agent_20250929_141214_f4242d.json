It leverages the Kafka Streams API to perform the joining operation and outputs the results to a designated Kafka topic. The implementation focuses on ensuring that the data is only combined under certain temporal conditions, using custom serializers and handling exceptions robustly.\n\n## Properties Configuration\n\n### Kafka Streams Configuration\n\nThe constructor of the `JsonKStreamJoins` class initializes a set of properties necessary for connecting to a Kafka cluster:\n\n- **Bootstrap Servers**: Points to the Kafka broker (`pkc-75m1o.europe-west3.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092`).\n- **Security Protocol**: Configured to use `SASL_SSL`.\n- **Authentication**: Uses JAAS for authentication, where the username and password are fetched from a `Secrets` class.\n- **Client Configuration**: Various settings, such as DNS lookup strategies and session timeout.\n- **Application ID**: Uniquely identifies the Kafka Streams application.\n- **Offset Reset Policy**: Configured to read the latest messages if no offsets are found.\n- **Buffering Configuration**: Set to disable the maximum bytes buffering.\n\n## Topology Creation\n\n### Stream Processing\n\nThe `createTopology` method is responsible for defining the data flow for the Kafka Streams application:\n\n1. **Stream Sources**: It creates two input streams:\n   - `rides`: Processes data from the `INPUT_RIDE_TOPIC`, deserialized into `Ride` objects using a custom serializer.\n   - `pickupLocations`: Processes data from the `INPUT_RIDE_LOCATION_TOPIC`, deserialized into `PickupLocation` objects.\n\n2. **Key Selection**: The `pickupLocations` stream is then re-keyed based on the `PULocationID`, which is intended for joining with rides.\n\n3. **Joining Streams**: \n   - A join operation between `rides` and `pickupLocationsKeyedOnPUId` is established. The `join` uses a `ValueJo",

The final results, containing `VendorInfo`, are sent to the `OUTPUT_TOPIC`.\n\n## Stream Execution\n\n### Kafka Streams Lifecycle Management\n\nThe `joinRidesPickupLocation` method executes and manages the Kafka Streams lifecycle:\n\n1. **Topology Building**: Calls the `createTopology` method to build the processing topology.\n2. **Stream Initialization**: Constructs a `KafkaStreams` instance with the defined topology and properties.\n3. **Exception Handling**: Sets an uncaught exception handler that will log any exceptions and shut down the application gracefully if errors occur.\n4. **Starting the Stream**: Initiates the stream and checks its state in a loop until it transitions to the `RUNNING` state.\n5. **Shutdown Hook**: Adds a shutdown hook to ensure the stream is closed properly on application termination.\n\n## Entry Point\n\n### Main Method\n\nThe `main` method serves as the entry point for running the `JsonKStreamJoins` application:\n\n1.

It includes examples of how to create a database connection, execute SQL queries, and load CSV data into the database.\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\nTo start, you'll need to install some essential packages. The following command installs SQLAlchemy and psycopg2-binary, which are required for database connectivity with PostgreSQL.\n\n```bash\npip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary \n```\n\n### Importing Necessary Libraries\n\nAfter installing the required packages, you should import the necessary libraries into your Python script. In this case, we are using the Pandas library for data manipulation and SQLAlchemy to manage the database connections.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n\n## Creating a Database Connection\n\nTo connect to a PostgreSQL database, you can use SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` function. This function constructs a connection string that specifies the database type, user credentials, host, and database name.\n\n```python\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')\n```\n\n### Verifying the Connection\n\nOnce you have created the engine, it's good practice to verify that the connection is successful. This can be done by calling the `connect()` method on the engine object.\n\n```python\nengine.connect()\n```\n\n## Executing Simple SQL Queries\n\nWith an established connection, you can execute SQL queries. \n\n### Example Query: Simple SELECT\n\nThe following SQL query selects a constant value and returns it. It serves as a simple test to check if the database is operational.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSELECT 1 as number;\n\"\"\"\n\npd.read_sql(query, con=engine)\n```\n\n### Querying Database Tables\n\nYou can query the existing tables in your database. The next block retrieves all user-defined tables, excluding system tables.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSEL",
              "code": false,
              "filename": "01-docker-terraform/2_docker_sql/pg-test-connection.ipynb"

The next block retrieves all user-defined tables, excluding system tables.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSELECT *\nFROM pg_catalog.pg_tables\nWHERE schemaname != 'pg_catalog' AND \n    schemaname != 'information_schema';\n\"\"\"\n\npd.read_sql(query, con=engine)\n```\n\n## Loading Data from CSV\n\nAfter validating the database queries, you may want to load external data into your database. This example shows how to read a CSV file containing taxi trip data.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv', nrows=100)\n```\n\n### Preprocessing Date Columns\n\nFor proper date-time representation, you need to convert string dates in the dataset to datetime objects. This step ensures that date-related functions operate correctly later on.\n\n```python\ndf.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)\ndf.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)\n```\n\n## Saving Data to the Database\n\nAfter loading and preprocessing the data, you can save it to your PostgreSQL database. The following command writes the DataFrame to a specified table without including the DataFrame index.\n\n",
