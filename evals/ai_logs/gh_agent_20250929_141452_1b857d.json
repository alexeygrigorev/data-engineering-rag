              "content": "# Analysis of the SQL Script\n\nThis SQL script primarily deals with creating and manipulating external tables related to taxi ride data in New York City, specifically focused on for-hire vehicle (FHV) trip data for the year 2019. The script includes operations for creating external tables, counting records, and creating new tables based on the external data.\n\n## Table Creation\n\n### External Table Definition\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\nThis part of the script creates or replaces an external table named `fhv_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny` project, specifically under the `nytaxi` dataset. The external table is defined to read CSV files stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The `uris` option points to all CSV files matching the pattern `fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv`, which includes all FHV trip data files for 2019. By using an external table, the content in the files can be queried directly without needing to load it into a regular database table.\n\n## Data Overview and Count\n\n### Total Records Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nThis query counts the total number of records present in the `fhv_tripdata` external table. This count can provide insights into the overall amount of trip data collected for the designated period.\n\n### Unique Dispatch Base Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dispatching_base_num)) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nHere, the script counts the number of distinct dispatching base numbers found in the `fhv_tripdata`. The dispatching base number is likely a unique identifier for the different taxi service providers. This query helps in understanding how many unique operators are present in the dataset.\n\n## Data Transformation\n\n### Non-Partitioned Table Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata`\nAS",
              "code": false,
              "filename": "03-data-warehouse/big_query_hw.sql"

            {
              "start": 1000,
              "content": "\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2019-*.csv', 'gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2020-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This command creates an external table named `external_yellow_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi` dataset. This table allows users to query the yellow taxi trip data stored in CSV files directly in GCS without importing them into BigQuery.\n\n## Validating Data from the External Table\n\nThe following query allows users to validate the creation and structure of the external table by retrieving a few records:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata LIMIT 10;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This query fetches the first 10 records from the `external_yellow_tripdata` table, serving as a sanity check to confirm that the data is accessible and correctly formatted.\n\n## Creating Non-Partitioned Table\n\nFollowing the validation, a non-partitioned table is created based on the external table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned AS\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This command generates a new table called `yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned` that stores all entries from the external yellow taxi trip data. This serves as a basic form of data extraction for further analysis without any partitioning for performance optimizations.\n\n## Creating a Partitioned Table\n\nThe next step involves creating a partitioned version of the yellow taxi trip data:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned\nPARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: A new table named `yellow_tripdata_partitioned` is created, partitioned by the `tpep_pickup_datetime` field. Partitioning improves query performance by limiting the amou",

This demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering in reducing the amount of data scanned during queries that use filters on clustered fields. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe series of SQL queries presented are designed to effectively utilize Google BigQuery features for managing and analyzing large datasets, like NYC yellow taxi and Citibike data. The use of external tables, partitioning, and clustering not only optimizes the performance of queries but also enhances data management practices for large-scale data analysis.",

The queries include interacting with both public data sets and external CSV datasets stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).\n\n## Querying NYC Citibike Stations\n\nThe initial query retrieves information from a public dataset that contains information about Citibike stations in New York City:\n\n```sql\nSELECT station_id, name FROM\n    bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This query selects the `station_id` and `name` of the first 100 Citibike stations from the `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations` table. The result provides a quick reference to the available stations in NYC.\n\n## Creating an External Table\n\nNext, the code defines an external table that references CSV files stored in Google Cloud Storage:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2019-*.csv', 'gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2020-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This command creates an external table named `external_yellow_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi` dataset.

              "content": "# Documentation for Taxi Ride Data Analysis Code\n\nThis document outlines the functionality of a SQL script designed for processing taxi ride data, training a machine learning model to predict tips, and evaluating its performance. \n\n## 1. Data Selection\n\n```sql\nSELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, PULocationID, DOLocationID, payment_type, fare_amount, tolls_amount, tip_amount\nFROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned` WHERE fare_amount != 0;\n```\n\nThe initial step involves querying a dataset containing information on taxi rides. The script selects specific columns that include passenger count, trip distance, pickup and drop-off location IDs, payment type, fare amounts, tolls, and tip amounts. Importantly, it filters out rows where the fare amount is zero, indicating that only valid trips are considered for further analysis.\n\n## 2. Creation of ML Table\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_ml` (\n`passenger_count` INTEGER,\n`trip_distance` FLOAT64,\n`PULocationID` STRING,\n`DOLocationID` STRING,\n`payment_type` STRING,\n`fare_amount` FLOAT64,\n`tolls_amount` FLOAT64,\n`tip_amount` FLOAT64\n) AS (\nSELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, cast(PULocationID AS STRING), CAST(DOLocationID AS STRING),\nCAST(payment_type AS STRING), fare_amount, tolls_amount, tip_amount\nFROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned` WHERE fare_amount != 0\n);\n```\n\nNext, a new table named `yellow_tripdata_ml` is created to store a Machine Learning (ML) relevant dataset. It includes the same selected columns and specifies appropriate data types for each column. The use of `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` indicates that if this table already exists, it will be replaced with the new data, ensuring that it always contains the most current data.\n\n## 3. Model Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.tip_model`\nOPTIONS\n(model_type='linear_reg',\ninput_label_cols=['tip_amount'],\nDATA_SPLIT_METHOD='AUTO_SPLIT') AS\nSELECT\n*\nFROM\n`taxi-rides-ny.nyt",

          "content": "The main differences between the green and yellow taxi trip data tables created in the SQL script can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Data Sources**:\n   - **Yellow Taxi Data**: The yellow taxi trip data is created from CSV files specifically named with the prefix `yellow_tripdata`, which includes data for both 2019 and 2020. This is setup through an external table:\n     ```sql\n     CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`\n     OPTIONS (\n       format = 'CSV',\n       uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2019-*.csv', 'gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2020-*.csv']\n     );\n     ```\n   - **Green Taxi Data**: The green taxi trip data is similarly sourced, but from files named with the prefix `green_tripdata`, covering a different timeframe and type of trips. The specific script for the green taxis was not detailed in the outputs but follows the same structure as the yellow data.\n\n2. **Table Schema and Columns**:\n   - Each of these tables will have distinct columns based on the data captured. Generally, yellow taxi data may include different fields compared to green taxi data, though both datasets typically include common fields such as pick-up and drop-off location identifiers, trip distances, and fare amounts.\n\n3. **Partitioning and Clustering**:\n   - The yellow taxi data includes operations for creating partitioned tables based on `tpep_pickup_datetime`, which aids in performance during querying. As illustrated, a partitioned table for yellow taxis was created:\n     ```sql\n     CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned\n     PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS\n     SELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;\n     ```\n   - It's likely that similar operations would be applied to the green taxi data if present.\n\n4. **Query Examples and Uses**:\n   - The SQL scripts will employ different queries for each dataset depending on the analysis needed. The yellow taxi data example includes performance tests comparing the partitioned and clustered tables, demonstrating a focus on efficient querying for analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Use-Cases**:\n   - Yellow taxi data might often be used for different metrics and analysis compared to green taxi data, as they cover different types of rides (with yellow primarily being hailed on the streets, while green taxis are more common in certain neighborhoods and typically respond to ride requests).\n\nThese differences highlight the distinct nature of each dataset tailored for specific analysis and usage within SQL scripts.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the SQL files in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-data-warehouse/big_query.sql).",
