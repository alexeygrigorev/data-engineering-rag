What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)?\n   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), used for provisioning infrastructure resources\n   * supports DevOps best practices for change management\n   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state \n     for testing and production environments\n2. What is IaC?\n   * Infrastructure-as-Code\n   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way \n     by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.\n3. Some advantages\n   * Infrastructure lifecycle management\n   * Version control commits\n   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8S\u2026\n   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments\n\n\n#### Files\n\n* `main.tf`\n* `variables.tf`\n* Optional: `resources.tf`, `output.tf`\n* `.tfstate`\n\n#### Declarations\n* `terraform`: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure\n   * `required_version`: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration\n   * `backend`: stores Terraform's \"state\" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration.\n      * `local`: stores state file locally as `terraform.tfstate`\n   * `required_providers`: specifies the providers required by the current module\n* `provider`:\n   * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage\n   * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.\n* `resource`\n  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure\n  * Project modules/resources: google_storage_bucket, google_bigquery_dataset, google_bigquery_table\n* `variable` & `locals`\n  * runtime arguments and constants\n\n\n#### Execution ste",

You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   terraform init\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Changes**: Always check what changes will be made before you apply or destroy anything. Use:\n   ```bash\n   terraform plan\n   ```\n\n3. **Destroy Resources**: To delete the infrastructure you created and avoid any ongoing charges for running services, you should use the `terraform destroy` command. This command will remove all resources managed by Terraform that are defined in your configuration files:\n   ```bash\n   terraform destroy\n   ```\n\nMake sure you review the output of the `terraform destroy` command before confirming the action, as it will display what resources are going to be destroyed. \n\nBy following these steps, you can safely manage and remove your Terraform-infrastructure without incurring unexpected costs. \n\nFor further details on Terraform commands, you can explore the documentation here: [Terraform GCP Documentation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/terraform/README.md).",
