Below is a detailed description of its components and functionality.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `VendorInfo` class encapsulates several properties associated with a vendor, such as identification and time-related data. It provides defined constructors to create instances of the class, facilitating both parameterized and default object creation.\n\n## Properties\n\n### VendorID (String)\n- **Description**: Represents a unique identifier for the vendor. It is stored as a `String` to accommodate potential alphanumeric vendor IDs.\n  \n### PULocationID (long)\n- **Description**: Indicates the pickup location ID for the vendor, stored as a numerical value (long). This allows for the reference of specific locations tied to the vendor's service area.\n\n### pickupTime (LocalDateTime)\n- **Description**: Captures the time at which a vendor picks up a customer or an item. This property is of the `LocalDateTime` type, which provides date and time resolution without timezone information.\n\n### lastDropoffTime (LocalDateTime)\n- **Description**: Records the most recent time when the vendor made a drop-off. Like `pickupTime`, it also utilizes the `LocalDateTime` type.\n\n## Constructors\n\n### VendorInfo(String vendorID, long PULocationID, LocalDateTime pickupTime, LocalDateTime lastDropoffTime)\n- **Purpose**: A parameterized constructor that allows the creation of a `VendorInfo` object with specified values for `VendorID`, `PULocationID`, `pickupTime`, and `lastDropoffTime`.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `vendorID`: A `String` representing the vendor's unique identifier.\n  - `PULocationID`: A `long` that denotes the pickup location.\n  - `pickupTime`: A `LocalDateTime` object indicating when the vendor picks up.\n  - `lastDropoffTime`: A `LocalDateTime` object representing the last drop-off time.\n\n### ",

It provides information about when the pickup occurred, which can be critical for time-dependent data analysis and reporting.\n\n## Constructors\nThe `PickupLocation` class includes two constructors, allowing for different ways to instantiate a `PickupLocation` object.\n\n### 1. Parameterized Constructor\n```java\npublic PickupLocation(long PULocationID, LocalDateTime tpep_pickup_datetime) {\n    this.PULocationID = PULocationID;\n    this.tpep_pickup_datetime = tpep_pickup_datetime;\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: This constructor allows for the creation of a `PickupLocation` object with specific values for both the `PULocationID` and the `tpep_pickup_datetime`. Utilizing this constructor ensures that both attributes can be set at the moment of object creation.\n\n### 2. Default Constructor\n```java\npublic PickupLocation() {\n}\n```\n- **Purpose**: The default constructor provides a way to create a `PickupLocation` object without requiring any initial values. This might be useful in scenarios where the attributes will be set later through other methods or setters.\n\n## Usage\nThe `PickupLocation` class can be utilized in various contexts within a larger application that manages ride-sharing or transportation services. When combined with other classes (perhaps representing drivers, passengers, or rides), it serves as a foundational element for tracking, managing, and analyzing transportation data.\n\n- **Example Instantiation**:\n    ```java\n    PickupLocation pickup = new PickupLocation(12345, LocalDateTime.now());\n    ```\n\nThis instance represents a pickup location with an ID of `12345` and the current date-time as the pickup time.\n\n## Advantages\nThe design of the `PickupLocation` class offers several advantages:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates ",

The `join` uses a `ValueJoiner` that checks if the difference between the drop-off and pickup times is within 10 minutes.\n   - If the condition is met, a new `VendorInfo` instance is created, containing the ride and location information.\n\n4. **Windowing**: The joining operation uses a time window of 20 minutes and a grace period of 5 minutes.\n\n5. **Filtering and Output**: After the join, the resulting stream is filtered to exclude any `Optional` values that are empty. The final results, containing `VendorInfo`, are sent to the `OUTPUT_TOPIC`.\n\n## Stream Execution\n\n### Kafka Streams Lifecycle Management\n\nThe `joinRidesPickupLocation` method executes and manages the Kafka Streams lifecycle:\n\n1. **Topology Building**: Calls the `createTopology` method to build the processing topology.\n2. **Stream Initialization**: Constructs a `KafkaStreams` instance with the defined topology and properties.\n3. **Exception Handling**: Sets an uncaught exception handler that will log any exceptions and shut down the application gra",
