Here are the key aspects and importance of the peer review process for completing the project:\n\n### Key Aspects:\n1. **Mandatory Evaluation**: To complete your project successfully, you must evaluate three peers' projects. If this requirement is not met, your project cannot be considered complete.\n2. **Submissions**: Each peer review involves submitting a form for each evaluated project, resulting in a total of three submissions.\n3. **Deadlines**: There are specific deadlines for submitting your own project and for completing peer reviews, which must be adhered to.\n\n### Importance:\n1. **Enhances Learning**: By reviewing peers' work, you gain new perspectives and insights that can enhance your understanding of the subject matter.\n2. **Quality Assurance**: The peer review process acts as a quality check for the projects submitted, ensuring that all work meets certain standards before the final submission.\n3. **Feedback Loop**: Provides an opportunity to receive constructive feedback on your own work, which can be invaluable for improvement.\n4. **Community Building**: Engaging with peers creates a sense of community and collaboration, fostering a supportive learning environment.\n\nIn summary, the peer review process is not only a requirement for project completion but also a critical component for personal and educational growth. It helps in refining the work, increases accountability, and enhances the overall learning experience.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the project documentation [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2023/project.md).",
