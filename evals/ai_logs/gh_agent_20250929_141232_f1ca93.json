Months are formatted to ensure two digits (e.g., '01', '02').\n\n3. **HTTP Request**: It downloads the CSV file from the constructed URL using the `requests` library. The downloaded content is saved as a local file.\n\n4. **Data Reading and Conversion**: The local CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame with gzip compression. It is then converted and saved as a Parquet file for efficient storage and querying.\n\n5. **GCS Upload**: The Parquet file is uploaded to the specified GCS bucket using the `upload_to_gcs` function.\n\n6. **Logging**: Throughout the process, the script outputs messages to provide feedback about the local file's creation and successful uploads to GCS.\n\n## Dataset Processing Execution\n\nAt the bottom of the script, two function calls for processing specific years and services are provided:\n\n```python\nweb_to_gcs('2019', 'green')\nweb_to_gcs('2020', 'green')\n```\n\nThese lines indicate that the script is set up to process green taxi data for the years 2019 and 2020. Additional lines for yellow taxi data are commented out, which implies they may be intended for future execution.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis script serves as a straightforward utility for downloading NYC taxi trip data, transforming it into a more efficient format, and uploading it to cloud storage. It can be easily extended by modifying the function calls for different years or service types, enhancing its versatility for various data processing needs.",

Clustering groups data with similar attributes closer together, enhancing performance during query operations.\n\n## Filtered Counts for Selected Dispatch Bases\n\n### Non-Partitioned Data Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM  `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata`\nWHERE DATE(dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'\n  AND dispatching_base_num IN ('B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060');\n```\n\nThis query counts the records in the `fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata` table where the drop-off date falls between January 1 and March 31, 2019, and the dispatching base number matches a specified set of values (`'B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060'`). This count helps to evaluate the number of trips made by specific taxi companies during the first quarter of 2019.\n\n### Partitioned Data Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_partitioned_tripdata`\nWHERE DATE(dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'\n  AND dispatching_base_num IN ('B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060');\n```\n\nThe final query performs a similar count, but this time against the `fhv_partitioned_tripdata`. The filtering criteria are the same as the previous query, allowing for direct comparison of performance and results between querying a partitioned and non-partitioned table. This will demonstrate how partitioning may affect query execution time and efficiency.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this script effectively sets up a workflow for managing and analyzing New York City's taxi ride data through various SQL operations. It:\n\n1. Creates an external representation of FHV trip data.\n2. Provides methods for counting total and unique entries.\n3. Transforms the external dataset into both non-partitioned and partitioned tables to enhance data management and query performance.\n4. Executes filtered queries to retrieve data for specified dispatch bases during the first quarter of 2019.\n\nBy structuring the data in partitioned formats, it aims ",

              "content": "MATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`\nWHERE table_name = 'yellow_tripdata_partitioned'\nORDER BY total_rows DESC;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This query retrieves information regarding the partitions of the `yellow_tripdata_partitioned` table, listing each partition's ID and the total number of rows it contains. This helps understand the distribution of data across partitions.\n\n## Creating a Partitioned and Clustered Table\n\nThe code then creates a table that combines both partitioning and clustering:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered\nPARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)\nCLUSTER BY VendorID AS\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This command creates a table named `yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered`, which is both partitioned by date and clustered by `VendorID`. Clustering helps to further optimize query performance by organizing the data within each partition based on `VendorID`.\n\n## Comparing Query Performance: Partitioned vs. Partitioned and Clustered\n\nLastly, two queries analyze the trip counts while checking the performance of the partitioned vs. partitioned and clustered tables:\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) as trips\nFROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned\nWHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2020-12-31'\n  AND VendorID=1;\n\nSELECT count(*) as trips\nFROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered\nWHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2020-12-31'\n  AND VendorID=1;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: The first query scans 1.1 GB of data, while the second query only scans 864.5 MB from the clustered table. This demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering in reducing the amount of data scanned during queries that use filters on clustered fields. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe series of SQL queries presented are designed to effectively utilize Google BigQuery features for managing and analyzing large datasets, like NYC yellow taxi and Citibi",
