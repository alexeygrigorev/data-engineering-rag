If your solution includes code that is not in file format, please include these directly in the README file of your repository.\n\n> In case you don't get one option exactly, select the closest one \n\nFor the homework, we'll be working with the _green_ taxi dataset located here:\n\n`https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/green/download`\n\nTo get a `wget`-able link, use this prefix (note that the link itself gives 404):\n\n`https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/`\n\n### Assignment\n\nSo far in the course, we processed data for the year 2019 and 2020. Your task is to extend the existing flows to include data for the year 2021.\n\n![homework datasets](../../../02-workflow-orchestration/images/homework.png)\n\nAs a hint, Kestra makes that process really easy:\n1. You can leverage the backfill functionality in the [scheduled flow](../../../02-workflow-orchestration/flows/06_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml) to backfill the data for the year 2021. Just make sure to select the time period for which data exists i.e. from `2021-01-01` to `2021-07-31`. Also, make sure to do the same for both `yellow` and `green` taxi data (select the right service in the `taxi` input).\n2. Alternatively, run the flow manually for each of the seven months of 2021 for both `yellow` and `green` taxi data. Challenge for you: find out how to loop over the combination of Year-Month and `taxi`-type using `ForEach` task which triggers the flow for each combination using a `Subflow` task.\n\n### Quiz Questions\n\nComplete the Quiz shown below. It\u2019s a set of 6 multiple-choice questions to test your understanding of workflow orchestration, Kestra and ETL pipelines for data lakes and warehouses.\n\n1) Within the execution for `Yellow` Taxi data for the ye",

This involves creating automated workflows that can handle tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) efficiently and reliably.\n\nIn this week's module of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp, the focus is on using **Kestra**, which is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform. Kestra simplifies the process of building both scheduled and event-driven workflows through Infrastructure as Code practices. It allows data engineers to construct workflows using simple YAML configurations, ensuring that processes are robust and can be managed effectively.\n\nWorkflow orchestration is essential for:\n- **Automating Repetitive Tasks**: By defining workflows, data engineers can automate routine data operations, reducing the likelihood of human error.\n- **Dependencies Management**: It manages task dependencies, ensuring that tasks are executed in the correct order and only when their prerequisite tasks have been successfully completed.\n- **Scheduling**: Orchestrators can be configured to run workflows on a schedule or in response to specific events, facilitating timely data processing.\n\nOverall, workflow orchestration in data engineering is about streamlining and automating data workflows, enhancing efficiency, reliability, and clarity within the data processing lifecycle.\n\nFor more insights, you can check the course material on this topic: [Workflow Orchestration - Module 2](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-workflow-orchestration/README.md).",
