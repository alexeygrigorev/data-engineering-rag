The model transforms raw trip data into a structured table for further analysis and reporting.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe model is designed to aggregate taxi trip data to analyze revenue trends by month and pickup zone. It retrieves data from a reference table, performs calculations on various revenue streams, and groups the results by revenue zone, revenue month, and service type.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe model is configured to be materialized as a table by the following line:\n\n```sql\n{{ config(materialized='table') }}\n```\n\nThis setting ensures that the output of this model is saved as a standalone table in the database, allowing for efficient querying of the aggregated results.\n\n## Data Source\n\nA Common Table Expression (CTE) named `trips_data` is defined to pull data from the reference table `fact_trips`. The base data comprises a wide range of fields related to taxi trips, including fare amounts, service types, pickup zones, and other relevant metrics.\n\n```sql\nwith trips_data as (\n    select * from {{ ref('fact_trips') }}\n)\n```\n\n## Revenue Metrics Calculation\n\nThe primary calculations in this model involve aggregating various revenue components for each revenue zone and month. The metrics calculated include:\n\n- **Revenue Grouping**:\n  - `pickup_zone` as `revenue_zone`: Represents the geographical area where passengers were picked up.\n  - `{{ dbt.date_trunc(\"month\", \"pickup_datetime\") }}` as `revenue_month`: Extracts the month from the pickup datetime to facilitate monthly aggregation.\n  - `service_type`: Specifies the type of service (e.g., standard ride, shared ride).\n\n- **Revenue Calculation**:\n  The following metrics are calculated as sums of individual components:\n  - `revenue_monthly_fare`: Total fare amounts for the month.\n  - `revenue_monthly_extra",

Here's a breakdown of how this process works:\n\n1. **Model Creation**: Initially, a linear regression model is created to predict the `tip_amount`. This model is trained using a dataset that excludes any rows with null `tip_amount` values. The `AUTO_SPLIT` method is employed to automatically divide the dataset into training and evaluation subsets.\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.tip_model`\n   OPTIONS\n   (model_type='linear_reg',\n   input_label_cols=['tip_amount'],\n   DATA_SPLIT_METHOD='AUTO_SPLIT') AS\n   SELECT\n   *\n   FROM\n   `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_ml`\n   WHERE\n   tip_amount IS NOT NULL;\n   ```\n\n2. **Model Evaluation**: After the model is trained, it undergoes evaluation to assess its predictive performance. This step utilizes the `ML.EVALUATE` function, which applies various metrics to gauge how well the model is able to predict `tip_amount`. The evaluation is performed on data that also excludes null values for `tip_amount`.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT\n   *\n   FROM\n   ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.tip_model`,\n   (\n   SELECT\n   *\n   FROM\n   `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_ml`\n   WHERE\n   tip_amount IS NOT NULL\n   ));\n   ```\n\n3. **Performance Metrics**: The performance of the model is measured using several metrics, which commonly include:\n   - **Accuracy**\n   - **Precision**\n   - **Recall**\n   These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to accurately predict outcomes, making it essential for ensuring that predictions can generalize well to unseen data.\n\n4. **Prediction and Explanation**: Once evaluated, the model can make predictions. The results of predictions can also be explained to identify which input features are most influential in determining the predicted tip amounts, enhancing the interpretability of the model.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation process in this SQL script systematically assesses the predictive ability of the model through various performance metrics and ensures that the model remains robust when applied to new data.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the SQL script [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-data-warehouse/big_query_ml.sql).",
