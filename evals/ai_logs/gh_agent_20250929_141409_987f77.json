This demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering in reducing the amount of data scanned during queries that use filters on clustered fields. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe series of SQL queries presented are designed to effectively utilize Google BigQuery features for managing and analyzing large datasets, like NYC yellow taxi and Citibike data. The use of external tables, partitioning, and clustering not only optimizes the performance of queries but also enhances data management practices for large-scale data analysis.",

This comparison illustrates the performance benefits gained from partitioning.\n\n## Exploring Partitions\n\nThe subsequent query checks the details of each partition created in the partitioned table:\n\n```sql\nSELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows\nFROM `nytaxi.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS`\nWHERE table_name = 'yellow_tripdata_partitioned'\nORDER BY total_rows DESC;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This query retrieves information regarding the partitions of the `yellow_tripdata_partitioned` table, listing each partition's ID and the total number of rows it contains. This helps understand the distribution of data across partitions.\n\n## Creating a Partitioned and Clustered Table\n\nThe code then creates a table that combines both partitioning and clustering:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered\nPARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime)\nCLUSTER BY VendorID AS\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This command creates a table named `yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered`, which is both partitioned by date and clustered by `VendorID`. Clustering helps to further optimize query performance by organizing the data within each partition based on `VendorID`.\n\n## Comparing Query ",

Clustering groups data with similar attributes closer together, enhancing performance during query operations.\n\n## Filtered Counts for Selected Dispatch Bases\n\n### Non-Partitioned Data Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM  `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata`\nWHERE DATE(dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'\n  AND dispatching_base_num IN ('B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060');\n```\n\nThis query counts the records in the `fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata` table where the drop-off date falls between January 1 and March 31, 2019, and the dispatching base number matches a specified set of values (`'B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060'`). This count helps to evaluate the number of trips made by specific taxi companies during the first quarter of 2019.\n\n### Partitioned Data Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_partitioned_tripdata`\nWHERE DATE(dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'\n  AND dispatching_base_num IN ('B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060');\n```\n\nThe final query performs a similar count, but this time against the `fhv_partitioned_tripdata`. The filtering criteria are the same as the previous query, allowing for direct comparison of performance and results between querying a partitioned and non-partitioned table. This will demonstrate how partitioning may affect query execution time and efficiency.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this script effectively sets up a workflow for managing and analyzing New York City's taxi ride data through various SQL operations. It:\n\n1. Creates an external representation of FHV trip data.\n2. Provides methods for counting total and unique entries.\n3. Transforms the external dataset into both non-partitioned and partitioned tables to enhance data management and query performance.\n4. Executes filtered queries to retrieve data for specified dispatch bases during the first quarter of 2019.\n\nBy structuring the data in partitioned formats, it aims ",

          "content": "Not partitioning or clustering the FHV 2019 data when working with BigQuery can lead to several implications, primarily affecting performance and cost efficiency:\n\n1. **Increased Data Scanning**: Non-partitioned tables require BigQuery to scan the entire dataset, which is inefficient. For instance, querying a non-partitioned table can result in scanning several gigabytes of data even if the query only pertains to a small date range. This can significantly increase query execution time and costs.\n\n2. **Higher Costs**: Since BigQuery charges based on the amount of data processed during queries, not partitioning will lead to higher costs. For example, a query that scans 1.6 GB of data from a non-partitioned table will be much more costly than one that only scans 106 MB from a partitioned table.\n\n3. **Slower Query Performance**: Without partitioning, queries that filter on specific dates or attributes will take longer to execute as they have to process the entire dataset. This can be particularly problematic during peak usage times or with larger datasets.\n\n4. **Reduced Manageability**: Partitioning helps in organizing data in a way that makes it easier to manage and query. Without it, data retrieval can become cumbersome, especially for large datasets, making maintenance and updates more complex.\n\n5. **Suboptimal Resource Utilization**: Not using clustering in conjunction with partitioning can lead to suboptimal resource utilization. Clustering organizes data within partitions, further reducing the amount of data scanned. Without clustering, the effectiveness of querying specific grouped attributes (like vendor IDs) is compromised.\n\nIn essence, failing to partition or cluster the FHV 2019 data can lead to inefficient queries, increased costs, and slower performance, ultimately hindering data analysis and insights retrieval capabilities. For more detailed implications on performance with partitioned and clustered tables, refer to the analysis reflected in the SQL examples outlined in the course materials. \n\nFor more information, you can check the resource here: [BigQuery SQL Practices](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-data-warehouse/big_query.sql).",
