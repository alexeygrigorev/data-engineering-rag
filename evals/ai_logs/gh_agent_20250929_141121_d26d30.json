          "content": "The `publishRides()` method in the given code is responsible for sending a list of `RideRecord` objects to a Kafka topic. Here's how this method handles errors during the sending process:\n\n1. **Use of Callback**: When sending the `ProducerRecord` to Kafka, a callback function is provided. This callback receives two parameters: `metadata` and `exception`. The `exception` parameter will contain any error that occurred during the message sending process.\n\n2. **Logging Errors**: Inside the callback, if an exception is not null (indicating an error occurred), it logs the error message to the console using `System.out.println(exception.getMessage());`. This allows the developer to see what went wrong during the operation.\n\n3. **Exception Propagation**: The method itself is designed to throw several exceptions (`ExecutionException`, `InterruptedException`), which means that calling methods higher in the stack can also handle these errors appropriately if needed.\n\nThe following code excerpt illustrates this error-handling approach:\n\n```java\nvar record = kafkaProducer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(...),\n    (metadata, exception) -> {\n        if (exception != null) {\n            System.out.println(exception.getMessage());\n        }\n    });\n```\n\nOverall, this approach ensures that while sending data to Kafka, any encountered errors are logged and can be acted upon, thereby enhancing the robustness of the application.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the source code in the repository here: [JsonProducer.java](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java).",
