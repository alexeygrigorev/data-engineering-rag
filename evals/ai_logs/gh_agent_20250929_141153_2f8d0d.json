              "content": "# JsonKStreamJoins Documentation\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `JsonKStreamJoins` class is designed to process data streams from Kafka topics, specifically for joining ride and pickup location data. It leverages the Kafka Streams API to perform the joining operation and outputs the results to a designated Kafka topic. The implementation focuses on ensuring that the data is only combined under certain temporal conditions, using custom serializers and handling exceptions robustly.\n\n## Properties Configuration\n\n### Kafka Streams Configuration\n\nThe constructor of the `JsonKStreamJoins` class initializes a set of properties necessary for connecting to a Kafka cluster:\n\n- **Bootstrap Servers**: Points to the Kafka broker (`pkc-75m1o.europe-west3.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092`).\n- **Security Protocol**: Configured to use `SASL_SSL`.\n- **Authentication**: Uses JAAS for authentication, where the username and password are fetched from a `Secrets` class.\n- **Client Configuration**: Various settings, such as DNS lookup strategies and session timeout.\n- **Application ID**: Uniquely identifies the Kafka Streams application.\n- **Offset Reset Policy**: Configured to read the latest messages if no offsets are found.\n- **Buffering Configuration**: Set to disable the maximum bytes buffering.\n\n## Topology Creation\n\n### Stream Processing\n\nThe `createTopology` method is responsible for defining the data flow for the Kafka Streams application:\n\n1. **Stream Sources**: It creates two input streams:\n   - `rides`: Processes data from the `INPUT_RIDE_TOPIC`, deserialized into `Ride` objects using a custom serializer.\n   - `pickupLocations`: Processes data from the `INPUT_RIDE_LOCATION_TOPIC`, deserialized into `PickupLocation` objects.\n\n2. **Key Selection**: The `pickupLocations` stream is then re-keyed based on the `PULocationID`, which is intended for joining with rides.\n\n3. **Joining Streams**: \n   - A join operation between `rides` and `pickupLocationsKeyedOnPUId` is established. The `join` uses a `ValueJo",

It uses a `StreamsBuilder` to define the flow of data processing:\n\n1. **Stream Definition**: It reads messages from the `rides` topic, using the custom serializer/deserializer for `Ride` objects.\n2. **Windowed Grouping and Counting**: The stream is grouped by their key and processed in time windows of 10 seconds, with a grace period of 5 seconds for late arriving data. The count of rides in each window is calculated.\n3. **Output Stream**: The result of the counting operation is sent to the `rides-pulocation-window-count` topic using a specified serializer for the window key and a long integer for the count.\n\n```java\npublic Topology createTopology() {\n    StreamsBuilder streamsBuilder = new StreamsBuilder();\n    var ridesStream = streamsBuilder.stream(\"rides\", Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), CustomSerdes.getSerde(Ride.class)));\n    var puLocationCount = ridesStream.groupByKey()\n            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeAndGrace(Duration.ofSeconds(10), Duration.ofSeconds(5)))\n            .count().toStream();\n    var windowSerde = WindowedSerdes.timeWindowedSerdeFrom(String.class, 10*1000);\n\n    puLocationCount.to(\"rides-pulocation-window-count\", Produced.with(windowSerde, Serdes.Long()));\n    return streamsBuilder.build();\n}\n```\n\n## Stream Processing\n### `countPLocationWindowed()`\nThis method initializes the Kafka Streams application:\n\n1. **Create Topology**: Invokes the `createTopology()` method to define the processing logic.\n2. **Start KafkaStreams Instance**: Creates a `KafkaStreams` object with the defined topology and properties, then calls `start()` to begin processing.\n3. **Shutdown Hook**: Registers a shutdown hook to cleanly close the Kafka Streams instance on application termination.\n\n```java\npublic void countPLo",
