It utilizes the Kafka Python client library to create a Kafka producer, which facilitates sending data to Apache Kafka.\n\n## Libraries Used\n- **csv**: This library is used to read the contents of the CSV file as a dictionary, where each row corresponds to a key-value pair based on the CSV headers.\n- **json**: This library allows the script to serialize Python dictionaries into JSON format, which is the format used to send data to Kafka.\n- **kafka**: Specifically, the `KafkaProducer` class from the `kafka` library is employed to establish a connection to the Kafka brokers and perform message sending operations.\n\n## Function: `main()`\nThe `main` function encapsulates the primary functionality of the script. Below is a breakdown of its tasks:\n\n### Kafka Producer Initialization\n1. **Producer Creation**: The script initializes a Kafka producer with the following configurations:\n   - **`bootstrap_servers`**: Specifies the address of the Kafka broker (in this case, `localhost:9092`).\n   - **`value_serializer`**: A lambda function that converts Python objects to JSON format, followed by encoding the string in UTF-8. This ensures that the data format is acceptable for Kafka.\n\n### Reading CSV File\n2. **CSV File Path**: The variable `csv_file` is set to the path of the CSV file that contains the green taxi trip data. Users are prompted to modify this path if needed.\n\n3. **Open CSV File**: The script uses a `with` statement to open the specified CSV file. This ensures the file is properly managed and closed after its content has been read.\n\n4. **CSV Reader**: A `csv.DictReader` is employed to read the contents of the CSV file. This reader converts each row into a dictionary where keys are the CSV headers, allowing easy access to the data.\n\n### Sending Data to Kafka\n5. **Iterate T",

It utilizes the `kafka-python` library to interact with Kafka, and the `Ride` class is presumably defined in another module, modeling the ride data structure. This script emphasizes modularity through the use of a dedicated class for producing JSON data and encapsulating the related logic.\n\n## Imports and Dependencies\n\nThe script imports several modules:\n- **csv**: To handle CSV file operations, allowing the reading of ride data from a CSV file.\n- **json**: For converting objects into JSON format to be sent to Kafka.\n- **List** and **Dict**: Type hinting provided by the `typing` library for better code clarity.\n- **KafkaProducer** and **KafkaTimeoutError**: Classes from the `kafka` module for producing messages to Kafka topics and handling potential timeout errors.\n- **Ride**: A custom class presumably defined in another module, which represents the structure of a ride.\n- **settings**: A module that includes configuration settings like Kafka server addresses, CSV input path, and Kafka topic.\n\n## JsonProducer Class\n\n### Overview\n\nThe `JsonProducer` class inherits from `KafkaProducer`. It serves as a specialized producer that can handle JSON serialization of ride data.\n\n### Initialization\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, props: Dict):\n    self.producer = KafkaProducer(**props)\n```\n\nThe constructor initializes the `JsonProducer` class by accepting a dictionary of properties (`props`) required for the `KafkaProducer`. This allows it to configure the Kafka connection according to the provided settings.\n\n### Read Records Method\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n    ...\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This static method reads ride records from a specified CSV file.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Opens the CSV file and uses a CSV reader to read its contents.\n  - Skips t",

The code is designed to read rides data from a CSV file and publish it to a Kafka topic.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary function of this script is to act as a producer that reads ride data from a specified CSV file and sends that data to a Kafka topic for consumption by other services. Utilizing the Kafka messaging system allows for efficient, scalable handling of streaming data in real-time applications.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe script relies on several external libraries:\n- **csv**: To handle reading from CSV files.\n- **time**: Specifically for adding pauses in execution (using `sleep`).\n- **kafka**: The `KafkaProducer` class is used to send data to a Kafka topic.\n- **settings**: This script imports several configuration constants (like the Kafka server address, input data path, and Kafka topic) from a separate settings module.\n\n## Functions\n\n### `delivery_report(err, msg)`\n\nThis function serves as a callback for reporting the status of messages sent to Kafka. It checks if there was an error (`err`), and if so, prints a failure message indicating the specific record and error information. If the message was successfully produced, it prints the details including the record key, topic, partition, and the offset at which it was stored.\n\n### `class RideCSVProducer`\n\nThe `RideCSVProducer` class encapsulates the functionality to produce ride records as follows:\n\n#### `__init__(self, props: Dict)`\n\nThe constructor initializes the `RideCSVProducer` instance. It creates a new `KafkaProducer` using properties passed through the `props` dictionary, which includes configurations like Kafka server addresses and serializers for keys and values.\n\n#### `read_records(resource_path: str)`\n\nThis static method reads ride records from the specified CSV file located at `resource_path`.

          "content": "The `read_records` method is designed to extract and format ride data from a CSV file so that it can be sent to a Kafka topic. Here's a breakdown of how this method operates:\n\n### Overview of `read_records` Method\n\n1. **Opening the CSV File**: The method begins by opening the CSV file specified by its `resource_path`.\n\n2. **Reading the CSV Content**: It employs a CSV reader (often `csv.DictReader`) to read the contents of the CSV. This allows each row in the CSV to be represented as a dictionary where the keys are the column headers, making it convenient to access data by its header name.\n\n3. **Skipping the Header Row**: As part of the functionality, the method skips the header row, which contains column names, to focus solely on the data rows.\n\n4. **Constructing Records**:\n   - For each subsequent row, it constructs instances of `RideRecord` and `RideRecordKey`, assuming these classes appropriately model the structure of the ride data.\n   - The method typically extracts specific columns from the CSV to populate these record instances.\n\n5. **Returning Data**: Finally, it returns a zipped list of keys and values (records), ready for publication.\n\n### Integration with Kafka\n\nThe ride records that are read from the CSV are then serialized (often into JSON format) and published to a Kafka topic using a dedicated producer method. This integration ensures that the ride data is made available for downstream processing in a Kafka-based streaming architecture.\n\n### Example Code Snippet\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified representation based on the description:\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n    with open(resource_path, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n        # Skip the header and process rows\n        for row in reader:\n            ride_record = RideRecord(...)  # Fill in details based on columns\n            ride_record_key = RideRecordKey(...)  # Create key based on logic\n            yield (ride_record_key, ride_record)\n```\n\nThis encapsulated method handles data extraction and formatting efficiently, allowing for seamless integration with Kafka messaging for real-time data processing.\n\n### Reference\nThis explanation is based on the `read_records` methods as described in the following source:\n- [Producer Code - Redpanda Example](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example/producer.py)\n- [Producer Code - Avro Example](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/avro_example/producer.py)\n- [Producer Code - JSON Example](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/json_example/producer.py)",
