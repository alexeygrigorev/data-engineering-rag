It outlines the key components, including classes and methods, and explains how they work together to produce records to a Kafka topic from a CSV file.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe script is designed to read ride data from a specified CSV file and produce messages to a Kafka topic. It uses the KafkaProducer from the Kafka library to send records containing ride information. The primary logic resides in the `RideCSVProducer` class, which encapsulates the functionality for reading CSV records and publishing them to a Kafka topic.\n\n## Imports and Dependencies\n\nThe script imports several modules:\n\n- **csv**: For reading the CSV file containing ride data.\n- **time**: Specifically the `sleep` function for pausing execution momentarily.\n- **typing**: Used for type annotations, specifically `Dict`.\n- **kafka**: The `KafkaProducer` class is imported to create a producer that can send messages to Kafka.\n- **settings**: Presumably contains configuration details such as Kafka server addresses, input file paths, and topic names.\n\n## Delivery Report Function\n\n```python\ndef delivery_report(err, msg):\n    ...\n```\n\n### Purpose\nThe `delivery_report` function serves as a callback to report the success or failure of a message sent to Kafka. It takes two parameters:\n\n- **err**: An exception object in case of failure, or `None` if the message was delivered successfully.\n- **msg**: The message object that was attempted to be sent, which contains metadata including its key, topic, partition, and offset.\n\n### Functionality\n- If `err` is not `None`, it indicates a failure in sending the message, and an error message is printed.\n- If the message is successfully produced, it logs the details of the message, including its key and location in the Kafka topic.\n\n## RideCSVProducer Class\n\n### Initialization\n```python\nclass RideCSVProducer:\n    def __init__(self, props: Dict):\n        ...\n",

The code is designed to read rides data from a CSV file and publish it to a Kafka topic.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary function of this script is to act as a producer that reads ride data from a specified CSV file and sends that data to a Kafka topic for consumption by other services. Utilizing the Kafka messaging system allows for efficient, scalable handling of streaming data in real-time applications.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe script relies on several external libraries:\n- **csv**: To handle reading from CSV files.\n- **time**: Specifically for adding pauses in execution (using `sleep`).\n- **kafka**: The `KafkaProducer` class is used to send data to a Kafka topic.\n- **settings**: This script imports several configuration constants (like the Kafka server address, input data path, and Kafka topic) from a separate settings module.\n\n## Functions\n\n### `delivery_report(err, msg)`\n\nThis function serves as a callback for reporting the status of messages sent to Kafka. It checks if there was an error (`err`), and if so, prints a failure message indicating the specific record and error information. If the message was successfully produced, it prints the details including the record key, topic, partition, and the offset at which it was stored.\n\n### `class RideCSVProducer`\n\nThe `RideCSVProducer` class encapsulates the functionality to produce ride records as follows:\n\n#### `__init__(self, props: Dict)`\n\nThe constructor initializes the `RideCSVProducer` instance. It creates a new `KafkaProducer` using properties passed through the `props` dictionary, which includes configurations like Kafka server addresses and serializers for keys and values.\n\n#### `read_records(resource_path: str)`\n\nThis static method reads ride records from the specified CSV file located at `resource_path`.

It reads records from a CSV file, serializes them according to predefined schemas, and publishes them to a Kafka topic, providing a delivery report on the success or failure of each message sent.\n\n## Key Imports\n\n1. **OS and CSV Libraries**: Used for file handling and parsing CSV files.\n2. **Confluent Kafka Library**: This library provides the necessary tools for producing messages to Kafka and for Avro serialization.\n3. **Custom Modules**: \n   - `ride_record_key` and `ride_record`: These modules define the data structures for the ride records and their keys.\n   - `settings`: Configuration parameters for Kafka, schema paths, and input data paths.\n\n## Delivery Report Function\n\n```python\ndef delivery_report(err, msg):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis function is called after attempting to send a message to Kafka. It checks for errors during the delivery process:\n- If an error occurred, it outputs an error message indicating which record failed.\n- If successful, it logs the details of the successfully produced record, including the topic, partition, and offset.\n\n## RideAvroProducer Class\n\n### Initialization\n\n```python\nclass RideAvroProducer:\n    def __init__(self, props: Dict):\n        ...\n```\n\nUpon instantiation, the `RideAvroProducer` class synchronizes with the schema registry and initializes the necessary serializers. It does the following:\n1. Loads the key and value schemas from the provided schema paths.\n2. Configures the Schema Registry client.\n3. Initializes Avro serializers for both keys and values.\n4. Sets up a Kafka producer with the provided bootstrap servers.\n\n### Load Schema\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef load_schema(schema_path: str):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis static method reads and returns the content of a schema file given its path.

It leverages the `csv`, `json`, and `kafka` libraries in Python, executing a straightforward process to facilitate the transfer of ride information.\n\n## Libraries and Dependencies\n\nThe script begins with the following imports:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom json import dumps\nfrom kafka import KafkaProducer\nfrom time import sleep\n```\n\n- **csv**: This module is used for reading and parsing CSV files. It allows for ease of access to data structured in rows and columns.\n  \n- **json.dumps**: This function converts Python objects into JSON strings, making it suitable for serializing the data before sending it over Kafka.\n\n- **KafkaProducer**: This class from the `kafka` library is used to send messages to a Kafka broker. The producer will be configured later with serializers for the keys and values.\n\n- **time.sleep**: This function pauses the execution of the script for a specified amount of time, allowing for the control of message flow to the Kafka topic.\n\n## Kafka Producer Initialization\n\nA Kafka producer is initialized with specific configurations:\n\n```python\nproducer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],\n                         key_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8'),\n                         value_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8'))\n```\n\n- **bootstrap_servers**: This parameter specifies the address of the Kafka broker. In this case, it points to a local server running on port 9092.\n\n- **key_serializer**: This lambda function serializes the key into a JSON string format and encodes it in UTF-8. The serialization allows the key to be sent as a uniform message over Kafka.\n\n- **value_serializer**: Similar to the key serializer, this function serializes the value to JSON format and encodes it to ensure compatibility with Kafka message formats.\n\n## CSV File Handling\n\nNext, the script opens the CSV file that ",

Here\u2019s how it manages error handling:\n\n1. **Parameters**:\n   - The function takes two parameters: `err` and `msg`.\n     - `err`: An exception object that indicates a failure during message delivery, or `None` if the message was successfully delivered.\n     - `msg`: The message object that contains metadata about the sent message, including its key, topic, partition, and offset.\n\n2. **Error Handling**:\n   - If `err` is not `None`, it signifies that an error occurred while sending the message. In this case, the function will print an error message that typically includes details about the record that failed to send and the specific error encountered.\n   - If the message is delivered successfully (i.e., `err` is `None`), the function logs a success message that includes details about the successfully delivered message, such as its key, the topic it was sent to, the partition, and the offset where it was stored.\n\nThis structured approach provides clear feedback on both successful and unsuccessful message deliveries, allowing developers to debug and monitor their Kafka messaging flows effectively.\n\nFor a complete reference, you can view the documentation of the `delivery_report` function in the context of the Kafka producer code here: [RideCSVProducer Code Documentation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/streams-example/pyspark/producer.py) and [Ride CSV Producer Documentation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/streams-example/redpanda/producer.py).",
