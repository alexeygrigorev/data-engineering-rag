We'll need\nto put these datasets to our data lake:\n\n* For the lessons, we'll need the Yellow taxi dataset (years 2019 and 2020)\n* For the homework, we'll need FHV Data (for-hire vehicles, for 2019 only)\n\nYou can find all the URLs on [the dataset page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)\n\n\nIn this homework, we will:\n\n* Modify the DAG we created during the lessons for transferring the yellow taxi data\n* Create a new dag for transferring the FHV data\n* Create another dag for the Zones data\n\n\nIf you don't have access to GCP, you can do that locally and ingest data to Postgres \ninstead. If you have access to GCP, you don't need to do it for local Postgres -\nonly if you want.\n\nAlso note that for this homework we don't need the last step - creating a table in GCP.\nAfter putting all the files to the datalake, we'll create the tables in Week 3.\n\n\n\n## Question 1: Start date for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)\n\nYou'll need to parametrize the DAG for processing the yellow taxi data that\nwe created in the videos. \n\nWhat should be the start date for this dag?\n\n* 2019-01-01\n* 2020-01-01\n* 2021-01-01\n* days_ago(1)\n\n\n## Question 2: Frequency for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)\n\nHow often do we need to run this DAG?\n\n* Daily\n* Monthly\n* Yearly\n* Once\n\n\n## Re-running the DAGs for past dates\n\nTo execute your DAG for past dates, try this:\n\n* First, delete your DAG from the web interface (the bin icon)\n* Set the `catchup` parameter to `True`\n* Be careful with running a lot of jobs in parallel - your system may not like it. Don't set it higher than 3: `max_active_runs=3`\n* Rename the DAG to something like `data_ingestion_gcs_dag_v02` \n* Execute it from the Airflow GUI (the play button)\n\n\nAlso, there's no data for the recent months, but `curl` will exit successfully.\nTo make it fail on 404, add the `-f` flag:\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSLf { URL } > { LOCAL_PATH }\n```\n\nWhen you run this for all the da",

This is done by transforming it into a list of dictionaries.\n\n```python\nfrom time import time\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\n\nmessages = df.to_dict(orient='records')\nlen(messages)\n```\n\nThis section accomplishes the following:\n- We import `time` for potential timing functionalities and `tqdm` for progress visualization.\n- The DataFrame is converted to a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a trip record.\n- The `len` function checks the number of messages to be sent, ensuring we know how many records are ready for processing.\n\n## Sending Messages to Kafka\n\nFinally, we send each message to the designated Kafka topic. The use of `tqdm` provides a visual progress bar indicating how many messages have been processed.\n\n```python\ntopic_name = 'green-trips'\n\nfor message in tqdm(messages):\n    producer.send(topic_name, value=message)\n\nproducer.flush()\n```\n\nIn this last block:\n- We set the topic name as 'green-trips'.\n- A loop iterates through the message list, sending each message to Kafka.\n- `producer.flush()` is called to ensure that all buffered records are transmitted before ending the session.\n\nThis documentation should guide you through using a Kafka producer to send NYC taxi trip data effectively.
