The default credentials to log in are:\n   - Username: `airflow`\n   - Password: `airflow`\n\n6. **Run Your DAG**: You can now run your workflows (DAGs) via the Web Console.\n\n7. **Shut Down the Containers**: Once you are finished, you can stop the containers with:\n   ```shell\n   docker-compose down\n   ```\n   To remove containers, delete volumes with database data, and remove downloaded images, you can run:\n   ```shell\n   docker-compose down --volumes --rmi all\n   ```\n   or \n   ```shell\n   docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans\n   ```\n\nThese commands set up and manage your Airflow environment locally with Docker. \n\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the [Airflow Setup Documentation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/README.md).",
