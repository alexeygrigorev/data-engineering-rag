The pipeline leverages table environments to operate on structured data processing efficiently using SQL-like syntax.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### Functions\n\n#### `create_processed_events_sink_postgres(t_env)`\n\n- **Purpose**: This function sets up a sink (output) table in a PostgreSQL database.\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `t_env`: The `TableEnvironment` object for managing SQL queries.\n- **Functionality**:\n  1. Defines a DDL (Data Definition Language) string to create a table named `processed_events`.\n  2. Specifies the schema of the table, including `test_data` (an integer) and `event_timestamp` (a timestamp).\n  3. Configures it to connect to a PostgreSQL database using specified connection properties (URL, table name, credentials).\n  4. Executes the DDL statement to create the table in the database.\n  5. Returns the name of the created table for further use.\n\n#### `create_events_source_kafka(t_env)`\n\n- **Purpose**: Sets up the source table that reads events from a Kafka topic.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `t_env`: The `TableEnvironment` object.\n- **Functionality**:\n  1. Initiates a DDL string to create a table named `events`.\n  2. Defines the schema for the table, which includes `test_data` (an integer) and `event_timestamp` (a BIGINT).\n  3. Also creates a watermarked column to handle event time processing.\n  4. Sets up configurations to connect to the Kafka broker, specifying properties for connection, topic name, data format, and startup mode.\n  5. Executes the SQL statement to create the Kafka source table.\n  6. Returns the name of the created table.\n\n### `log_pr",

This data flow is crucial for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.\n\n5. **Exception Handling**: Any exceptions that occur during the data writing process to PostgreSQL are caught and logged, preventing the application from crashing unexpectedly.\n\n## Execution Entry Point\n\nLastly, within the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, the `log_processing` function is invoked to start the streaming data pipeline. This section ensures that the processing begins only when the script is run as the main module, thereby allowing it to function correctly as an executable script.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this PyFlink script demonstrates a typical use case of streaming data applications: ingesting data from a Kafka topic, processing it, and writing the results into a PostgreSQL database. The defined functions modularize responsibilities, allowing for easy adjustments or enhancements in future implementations. This structure follows a clear pattern of creating source and sink, executing data flows, and managing the runtime environment in a robust manner, suitable for real-time data analytics.",

Hands-On Coding Project: Build Data Pipelines with Kestra\n\nThis week, we're gonna build ETL pipelines for Yellow and Green Taxi data from NYC\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). You will:\n1. Extract data from [CSV files](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases).\n2. Load it into Postgres or Google Cloud (GCS + BigQuery).\n3. Explore scheduling and backfilling workflows.\n\n>[!NOTE] \nIf you\u2019re using the PostgreSQL and PgAdmin docker setup from Module 1 for this week\u2019s Kestra Workflow Orchestration exercise, ensure your PostgreSQL image version is 15 or later (preferably the latest). The MERGE statement, introduced in PostgreSQL 15, won\u2019t work on earlier versions and will likely cause syntax errors in your kestra flows.\n\n### File Structure\n\nThe project is organized as follows:\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 flows/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 01_getting_started_data_pipeline.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02_postgres_taxi.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02_postgres_taxi_scheduled.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 03_postgres_dbt.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 04_gcp_kv.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 05_gcp_setup.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 06_gcp_taxi.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 06_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 07_gcp_dbt.yaml\n```\n\n### Setup Kestra\n\nWe'll set up Kestra using Docker Compose containing one container for the Kestra server and another for the Postgres database:\n\n```bash\ncd 02-workflow-orchestration/docker/combined\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\nOnce the container starts, you can access the Kestra UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://loc",

By leveraging Flask's capabilities for distributed streaming computations and using watermarks for handling late data, it ensures that the application remains robust and reliable under varying data arrival patterns. This modular design makes it easy to expand or modify for different use cases or data sources.",

Each section outlines specific steps, along with code examples and explanations.\n\n## Importing Required Libraries\n\nBefore processing the taxi data, it is essential to import the necessary libraries, particularly Pandas for data manipulation. \n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\nTo verify that the correct version of Pandas is installed, you can check the version as follows:\n\n```python\npd.__version__\n```\n\n## Loading Initial Data\n\nIn this section, we read a sample of the NYC taxi trip data from a CSV file. By limiting the rows to 100, we can quickly review the structure of the dataset without exhausting resources.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv', nrows=100)\n```\n\nNext, we transform the pickup and dropoff datetime columns into a compatible format using Pandas' `to_datetime` method, which allows for easier date-time manipulation later.\n\n```python\ndf.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)\ndf.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)\n```\n\n## Setting Up the Database Connection\n\nTo store the processed data, we need to establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n\nHere, we create an engine with the appropriate connection string pointing to our PostgreSQL database.\n\n```python\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')\n```\n\nWe can then preview the SQL schema that will be generated based on our dataframe's structure.\n\n```python\nprint(pd.io.sql.get_schema(df, name='yellow_taxi_data', con=engine))\n```\n\n## Reading Data in Chunks\n\nFor large datasets, it's often impractical to load everything into memory at once. Instead, we can read data in chunks. Here, we set up an iterator to read the taxi trip data in chunks of 100,000 rows at a tim",

          "content": "This week\u2019s coding project focuses on building ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for NYC's Yellow and Green Taxi data, utilizing PostgreSQL for data storage. Here are details regarding the file structure and ensuring the correct PostgreSQL version:\n\n### File Structure\nThe project is organized as follows:\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 flows/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 01_getting_started_data_pipeline.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02_postgres_taxi.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 02_postgres_taxi_scheduled.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 03_postgres_dbt.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 04_gcp_kv.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 05_gcp_setup.yaml\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 06_gcp_taxi.yaml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 06_gcp_taxi_scheduled.yaml\n```\nEach YAML file contains the orchestration configurations for different stages and tasks of the pipeline ([source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-workflow-orchestration/README.md)).\n\n### PostgreSQL Version\nTo avoid syntax errors, especially when using the MERGE statement (introduced in PostgreSQL 15), it\u2019s crucial to ensure that your PostgreSQL version is **15 or later**. If you are using Docker for your PostgreSQL setup, make sure to pull the latest image that meets this version requirement. If you're working with an earlier version, you may encounter compatibility issues while executing your flows ([source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-workflow-orchestration/README.md)).\n\nEnsure you can verify the PostgreSQL version by running the following command in your terminal:\n```bash\npsql --version\n```\n\nMake sure to check and confirm your environment settings related to PostgreSQL before proceeding with the implementation.
