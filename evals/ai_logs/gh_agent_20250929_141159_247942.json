JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines alike.\n- This transformation is essential when preparing data for ingestion into a message broker like Kafka.\n\n### Kafka Publishing\n- After the data has been transformed into the necessary format, the next step would be to establish a connection to the Kafka broker as specified by the `BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`.\n- The script would then create a producer instance that prepares to send messages to the Kafka topic defined by `KAFKA_TOPIC`.\n\n### Sending Messages\n- The script would loop over each entry (or ride) in the processed data and send each serialized JSON message to the Kafka topic. This allows for real-time processing and can facilitate further analysis or storage in systems designed to handle streaming data.\n\n### Error Handling and Logging\n- While not covered in the snippet, good practice in such scripts typically involves including error handling to manage issues related to data loading, transformation, and communication with Kafka.\n- Additionally, logging the success or failure of each operation is important for monitoring and debugging purposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, this code sets up the initial configurations needed to read ride data from a CSV file and send it to a Kafka topic after transforming it into the appropriate format. The constants defined indicate a focus on local development/testing, with an eye towards real-time data processing. This is a foundational step in constructing a data pipeline that could be expanded upon with additional functionality such as data validation, more complex transformations, or integration with other systems and services.",

          "content": "In the `publishRides` method, various error handling mechanisms are used when sending records to Kafka. Here are the key points regarding error handling:\n\n1. **Callback Function**: When sending a record to Kafka using the `send` method, a callback is employed that allows the application to handle exceptions that may arise during the send operation. This callback checks if an exception occurred while sending the record and logs the exception message to the console if it did.\n\n   ```java\n   var record = kafkaProducer.send(new ProducerRecord<>(...),\n       (metadata, exception) -> {\n           if(exception != null) {\n               System.out.println(exception.getMessage());\n           }\n       });\n   ```\n\n2. **Exception Propagation**: The method signatures for `publishRides` indicate that it declares potential exceptions (`ExecutionException` and `InterruptedException`) that can be thrown. This allows these exceptions to be handled at a higher level in the code, potentially by the caller of this method.\n\n3. **Logging**: The method logs the offset of the published record which helps in understanding the success of the operation. If an error occurs, the callback that is triggered ensures that the error message gets printed, providing insight into the issues encountered.\n\n4. **Delay Between Sends**: Although not directly related to error handling, a delay of 500 milliseconds between sending records is implemented, which can help reduce the risk of causing too much load on Kafka and potentially encountering network-related errors.\n\nOverall, the `publishRides` method implements a structured approach to handling errors during the sending of records to Kafka, utilizing callbacks for immediate error logging and exception management strategies for broader handling.\n\nFor further details, see the source: [JsonProducer.java](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java).",
