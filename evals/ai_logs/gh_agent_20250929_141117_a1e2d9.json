It outlines the key components, including classes and methods, and explains how they work together to produce records to a Kafka topic from a CSV file.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe script is designed to read ride data from a specified CSV file and produce messages to a Kafka topic. It uses the KafkaProducer from the Kafka library to send records containing ride information. The primary logic resides in the `RideCSVProducer` class, which encapsulates the functionality for reading CSV records and publishing them to a Kafka topic.\n\n## Imports and Dependencies\n\nThe script imports several modules:\n\n- **csv**: For reading the CSV file containing ride data.\n- **time**: Specifically the `sleep` function for pausing execution momentarily.\n- **typing**: Used for type annotations, specifically `Dict`.\n- **kafka**: The `KafkaProducer` class is imported to create a producer that can send messages to Kafka.\n- **settings**: Presumably contains configuration details such as Kafka server addresses, input file paths, and topic names.\n\n## Delivery Report Function\n\n```python\ndef delivery_report(err, msg):\n    ...\n```\n\n### Purpose\nThe `delivery_report` function serves as a callback to report the success or failure of a message sent to Kafka. It takes two parameters:\n\n- **err**: An exception object in case of failure, or `None` if the message was delivered successfully.\n- **msg**: The message object that was attempted to be sent, which contains metadata including its key, topic, partition, and offset.\n\n### Functionality\n- If `err` is not `None`, it indicates a failure in sending the message, and an error message is printed.\n- If the message is successfully produced, it logs the details of the message, including its key and location in the Kafka topic.\n\n## RideCSVProducer Class\n\n### Initialization\n```python\nclass RideCSVProducer:\n    def __init__(self, props: Dict):\n        ...\n",

Based on this argument, it sets the appropriate Kafka topic and data file path for the rides.\n\nWith this information, a `RideCSVProducer` instance is created, and the script reads the corresponding records from the specified CSV file. Finally, it calls the `publish` method to send these records to the designated Kafka topic.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this script is a Kafka producer for ride data that:\n\n1. Imports necessary libraries and settings.\n2. Defines a `RideCSVProducer` class responsible for handling the parsing of CSV rows, reading the CSV file contents, and publishing the records to a Kafka topic.\n3. Uses command-line arguments to determine the type of ride being processed, adjusts the topic and file path accordingly, and executes the necessary methods to read and publish the ride data. \n\nThis structured approach allows for flexible integration with Kafka while maintaining clean and manageable code.",

It leverages the Confluent Kafka library to manage the Kafka producer functionality, and allows for different types of ride data (Green and FHV) to be processed and sent. \n\n## Libraries and Imports\n\nThe script begins by importing essential libraries:\n\n- **confluent_kafka**: A Python client for Apache Kafka that allows message production and consumption.\n- **argparse**: A module for parsing command-line arguments, enabling users to specify input parameters when running the script.\n- **csv**: A module for reading and writing CSV files, which is integral for processing the ride data.\n- **typing**: Provides type hints, specifically for the `Dict` data type to specify the structure of input parameters.\n- **time**: Used for adding delays (with `sleep`).\n- **settings**: This module (assumed to exist) contains configurations such as Kafka connection details and file paths.\n\n## RideCSVProducer Class\n\n### Initialization\n\nThe core class defined in the script is `RideCSVProducer`, which is initialized with:\n\n- **probs (Dict)**: A dictionary with the Kafka producer configuration parameters.\n- **ride_type (str)**: The type of ride data being processed (either 'green' or 'fhv').\n\nWithin the constructor, a Kafka producer instance is created using the provided configuration, and the ride type is stored for later processing.\n\n### Parsing CSV Rows\n\nThe `parse_row` method is responsible for interpreting individual rows of the CSV files based on the ride type:\n\n- For 'green' rides, it extracts the `PULocationID` (pickup) and `DOLocationID` (drop-off) from specific columns and uses `vendor_id` as the key.\n- For 'fhv' (for-hire vehicle) rides, it retrieves values from different columns but similarly constructs a record of `PULocationID` and `DOLocationID`, with `dispatching_base_num` used as the key.\n\nThis method returns a tuple contain",

It effectively encapsulates the Kafka interaction within the `RideCSVProducer` class, separating concerns between data reading and producing, making the code manageable and extendable. The script includes error handling for situations where message delivery may fail, ensuring robustness in message production.",

The code is designed to read rides data from a CSV file and publish it to a Kafka topic.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary function of this script is to act as a producer that reads ride data from a specified CSV file and sends that data to a Kafka topic for consumption by other services. Utilizing the Kafka messaging system allows for efficient, scalable handling of streaming data in real-time applications.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe script relies on several external libraries:\n- **csv**: To handle reading from CSV files.\n- **time**: Specifically for adding pauses in execution (using `sleep`).\n- **kafka**: The `KafkaProducer` class is used to send data to a Kafka topic.\n- **settings**: This script imports several configuration constants (like the Kafka server address, input data path, and Kafka topic) from a separate settings module.\n\n## Functions\n\n### `delivery_report(err, msg)`\n\nThis function serves as a callback for reporting the status of messages sent to Kafka. It checks if there was an error (`err`), and if so, prints a failure message indicating the specific record and error information. If the message was successfully produced, it prints the details including the record key, topic, partition, and the offset at which it was stored.\n\n### `class RideCSVProducer`\n\nThe `RideCSVProducer` class encapsulates the functionality to produce ride records as follows:\n\n#### `__init__(self, props: Dict)`\n\nThe constructor initializes the `RideCSVProducer` instance. It creates a new `KafkaProducer` using properties passed through the `props` dictionary, which includes configurations like Kafka server addresses and serializers for keys and values.\n\n#### `read_records(resource_path: str)`\n\nThis static method reads ride records from the specified CSV file located at `resource_path`.
