After repartitioning, we save the DataFrame back to disk in Parquet format.\n\n```python\ndf = df.repartition(4)\ndf.write.parquet('data-out')\n```\n\n## Creating Temporary Views\n\nWe create temporary views of both our main dataset and taxi zones dataset. Temporary views allow us to execute SQL queries directly within Spark, making data manipulation more flexible.\n\n```python\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView('hw5')\n```\n\n```python\n!ls -lh data-out\n```\n\n## Filtering and Counting Records\n\nWe filter the DataFrame for trips that occurred on a specific date, '2024-10-15', and count the number of records. This operation demonstrates how to use date functions in PySpark.\n\n```python\ndf.withColumn('pickup_date', F.to_date(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)) \\\n    .filter(\"pickup_date = '2024-10-15'\") \\\n    .count()\n```\n\n### SQL Query for Date Filtering\n\nWe perform the same filtering using SQL syntax. This SQL query counts all trips where the pickup date matches '2024-10-15', showcasing the capability of executing SQL commands on Spark DataFrames.\n\n```python\nspark.sql(\"\"\" \nSELECT count(*)\nFROM hw5\nWHERE cast(tpep_pickup_datetime as date) = '2024-10-15'\nand tpep_pickup_datetime is not null\n\"\"\").show()\n```\n\n## Calculating Trip Duration\n\nIn this section, we calculate the duration of taxi trips by subtracting the pickup time from the dropoff time. The results are ordered by duration, allowing us to identify the longest trips.\n\n```python\ndf.withColumn('duration', (df.tpep_dropoff_datetime.cast('long') - df.tpep_pickup_datetime.cast('long'))/60/60) \\\n    .orderBy('duration', ascending=False) \\\n    .limit(5) \\\n    .select(\"duration\") \\\n    .show()\n```\n\n### Defining Taxi Zone Schema\n\nBefore we load the taxi zone data, we define its schema to ensure the data types are correctly interpreted when reading from the CSV file. This structured approach helps avoid type-related errors during analysis.\n\n```python\ntaxi_zone_schema = types.StructType([\n    types.StructField('LocationID', types.IntegerTy",

The number of passengers\n\nIn 2019-01-01 how many trips had 2 and 3 passengers?\n \n- 2: 1282 ; 3: 266\n- 2: 1532 ; 3: 126\n- 2: 1282 ; 3: 254\n- 2: 1282 ; 3: 274\n\n\n## Question 6. Largest tip\n\nFor the passengers picked up in the Astoria Zone which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?\nWe want the name of the zone, not the id.\n\nNote: it's not a typo, it's `tip` , not `trip`\n\n- Central Park\n- Jamaica\n- South Ozone Park\n- Long Island City/Queens Plaza\n\n\n## Submitting the solutions\n\n* Form for submitting: [form](https://forms.gle/EjphSkR1b3nsdojv7)\n* You can submit your homework multiple times.

Within this function, the streaming environment and table environments are initialized, followed by the creation of both source and sink tables.\n3.

          "content": "To count the total number of taxi trips made on January 15, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: Load your taxi trip data into PostgreSQL. Ensure you have the relevant columns, especially `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime`, which both contain timestamps.\n\n2. **Formulate the Query**: You need to write a SQL query that selects the records from your dataset where the pickup date is January 15:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT COUNT(*) \n   FROM taxi_trips \n   WHERE DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) = '2019-01-15';\n   ```\n\n   This query counts the number of trips that started on January 15.\n\n3. **Consider Timestamp Format**: In PostgreSQL, timestamps include both date and time (down to seconds). Your trip data is in timestamp format, so you will need to ensure that your date comparison (e.g., `DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime)`) correctly extracts the date portion from the timestamp.\n\nFrom the documents, it's confirmed that the date and time data for the taxi trips are stored as timestamps, requiring you to take note of this when performing comparisons:\n\n- Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not just date. You need to convert it or extract the date accordingly when querying.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, please refer to the homework document: [homework.md](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2023/week_1_docker_sql/homework.md).",
