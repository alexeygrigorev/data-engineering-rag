These parameters include identifying data and various attributes that characterize the ride (such as time, distance, fare, etc.).\n\n### Typical Output\nThe output will be a `Ride` object initialized with set values that are relevant for use in testing or data generation.\n\n## Method: `generatePickUpLocation(long pickupLocationId)`\n\n### Purpose\nThe `generatePickUpLocation` method is responsible for creating a `PickupLocation` object, which holds information about a pickup location.\n\n### Functionality\n1. **Pickup Location ID**: The method takes a `long` parameter representing the unique ID for the pickup location.\n2. **Current Timestamp**: It captures the current date and time to assign to the pickup location.\n3. **Pickup Location Creation**: The method returns a new `PickupLocation` object, instantiated with the provided ID and the current timestamp.\n\n### Typical Output\nThe output will be a `PickupLocation` object encapsulating the pickup location ID and the timestamp of its creation.\n\n## Usage Context\n\nThis `DataGeneratorHelper` class is likely used in testing scenarios where instances of `Ride` and `PickupLocation` are needed. It helps automate the generation of realistic data for development purposes, making it easier for developers and testers to simulate various situations without manually inputting each data point.\n\n### Integration\n- **Dependencies**: The class relies on the `Ride` and `PickupLocation` classes from the `org.example.data` package. Ensure that these classes are properly defined to utilize this helper effectively.\n- **Dynamic Data Simulation**: By providing current timestamps and configurable pickup IDs, the methods allow for dynamic test scenarios where varying conditi",

Essentially, you will create a query that identifies the top three zones based on the number of pickups, filtered by the latest pickup time and up to 17 hours prior.\n\n### Example SQL Query\nHere's a structured way to approach this using SQL, as mentioned in the course:\n\n```sql\nWITH latest_time AS (\n    SELECT MAX(pickup_time) AS max_pickup_time\n    FROM trip_data\n)\nSELECT zone, COUNT(*) AS pickup_count\nFROM trip_data\nJOIN taxi_zone ON trip_data.pickup_zone_id = taxi_zone.id\nWHERE pickup_time >= (SELECT max_pickup_time - INTERVAL '17 hours' FROM latest_time)\n  AND pickup_time <= (SELECT max_pickup_time FROM latest_time)\nGROUP BY zone\nORDER BY pickup_count DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Latest Time CTE**: Fetches the maximum pickup time from the trip data.\n2. **Zone Aggregation**: Joins the trip data with the taxi zones to count pickups per zone.\n3. **Dynamic Filtering**: Limits the results to the specified period (latest time to 17 hours prior).\n4. **Ordering and Limiting**: Orders by the count of pickups in descending order and limits the results to the top three zones.\n\n### Notes:\n- Adjust your field names based on your actual database schema (e.g., `pickup_time`, `pickup_zone_id`).\n- Ensure you implement the [dynamic filter pattern](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/sql-pattern-dynamic-filters/) correctly for your use case.\n\nThe options for the top three busiest zones based on this query could include:\n1. Clinton East, Upper East Side North, Penn Station\n2. LaGuardia Airport, Lincoln Square East, JFK Airport\n3. Midtown Center, Upper East Side South, Upper East Side North\n4.
