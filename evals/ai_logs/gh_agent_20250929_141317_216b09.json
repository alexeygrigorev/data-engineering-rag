          "content": "If your Docker setup for Apache Airflow is continuously restarting, you can take the following steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Container Status**: Use the command `docker-compose ps` to see which containers are up and running. You should see several containers listed. If any are continuously restarting, note which ones.\n\n2. **Inspect Logs**: You can check the logs of specific containers to identify any error messages that may be causing them to restart. Use:\n   ```shell\n   docker-compose logs <service_name>\n   ```\n   Replace `<service_name>` with the name of the service that is restarting (like `webserver`, `scheduler`, etc.).\n\n3. **Prune Docker System**: If there are pre-cached Docker issues, you can clean up unused Docker resources, which may help:\n   ```shell\n   docker system prune\n   ```\n\n4. **Rebuild Docker Images**: If you've made changes or if the images are potentially broken, rebuild the images:\n   ```shell\n   docker-compose build\n   ```\n\n5. **Initialize Services Properly**: Make sure to run the initialization command if needed. This is typically done by:\n   ```shell\n   docker-compose up airflow-init\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Database Setup**: It's often the case that the Airflow webserver and scheduler can't start due to database connection issues. Make sure your database is set up correctly and the connection information in your `docker-compose.yml` file is accurate.\n\n7. **Environmental Variables**: Ensure that any required environmental variables for Airflow are correctly set. This includes database connection strings and Airflow configurations.\n\n8. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure that your Docker and Airflow versions are compatible with each other. Sometimes, certain features or setups require specific versions.\n\n9. **Logs Directory**: Clear out the Airflow logs directory within the container, as bloated logs can sometimes cause issues.\n\n10. **Container Configuration**: Review your `docker-compose.yml` file for misconfigurations or incorrect settings.\n\nIf you've tried these steps and still face issues, please check the official Airflow documentation or consult community forums for additional support. \n\nFor more detailed steps, refer to the setup guide in the Airflow documentation included in the course material: [Airflow Setup with Docker](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/README.md).",
