This method can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially if dealing with large datasets.\n\n### ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)\n1. **Extract**: Data is extracted from source systems.\n2. **Load**: Instead of transforming the data first, it is loaded directly into the data warehouse.\n3. **Transform**: The transformation processes take place after the data has been loaded into the warehouse. This allows for more flexible and dynamic data manipulation.\n\nELT is favored in modern cloud data warehouse environments, where computing resources are scalable and can handle large datasets without needing to pre-transform data. This allows for quicker ingestion and querying capabilities.\n\nIn summary:\n- **ETL** is a method where data is transformed before loading, suitable for structured data needs and traditional data storage.\n- **ELT** allows data to be loaded in its raw form and transformed afterwards, offering flexibility and scalability, ideal for modern data environments.\n\nFor further details, refer to the relevant sections in the sources about data engineering tools and principles: [Awesome Data Engineering](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/awesome-data-engineering.md).",
