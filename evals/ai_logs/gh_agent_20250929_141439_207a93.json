              "content": "# NYC Taxi Data Processing\n\nThis documentation provides an overview of the process for loading, transforming, and storing NYC taxi trip data using Python, Pandas, and SQLAlchemy. Each section outlines specific steps, along with code examples and explanations.\n\n## Importing Required Libraries\n\nBefore processing the taxi data, it is essential to import the necessary libraries, particularly Pandas for data manipulation. \n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\nTo verify that the correct version of Pandas is installed, you can check the version as follows:\n\n```python\npd.__version__\n```\n\n## Loading Initial Data\n\nIn this section, we read a sample of the NYC taxi trip data from a CSV file. By limiting the rows to 100, we can quickly review the structure of the dataset without exhausting resources.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv', nrows=100)\n```\n\nNext, we transform the pickup and dropoff datetime columns into a compatible format using Pandas' `to_datetime` method, which allows for easier date-time manipulation later.\n\n```python\ndf.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)\ndf.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)\n```\n\n## Setting Up the Database Connection\n\nTo store the processed data, we need to establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n\nHere, we create an engine with the appropriate connection string pointing to our PostgreSQL database.\n\n```python\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')\n```\n\nWe can then preview the SQL schema that will be generated based on our dataframe's structure.\n\n```python\nprint(pd.io.sql.get_schema(df, name='yellow_taxi_data', con=engine))\n```\n\n## Reading Data in Chunks\n\nFor large datasets, it's often impractical to load everything into memory at once. Instead, we can read data in chunks. Here, we set up an iterator to read the taxi trip data in chunks of 100,000 rows at a tim",

              "content": "# Data Loading\n\nIn this document, we will outline the process of loading a Parquet file into a PostgreSQL database. This includes checking metadata, converting the file to a Pandas DataFrame, generating SQL statements, establishing a database connection, and finally inserting the data into the database. We'll also cover handling both CSV and Parquet files for flexibility.\n\n## Initial Setup \n\nTo begin, we first import the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `SQLAlchemy`. These libraries will facilitate reading the Parquet file, manipulating data, and connecting to the SQL database.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd \nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\nfrom time import time\n```\n\n## Reading Metadata from the Parquet File\n\nNext, we will read the metadata from the specified Parquet file. This step helps us understand the structure and schema of the data without loading it entirely into memory.\n\n```python\n# Read metadata \npq.read_metadata('yellow_tripdata_2023-09.parquet')\n```\n\n## Reading Data and Schema Check\n\nWe will now read the full Parquet file and check its schema. Understanding the schema ensures that we know the data types and structure before converting the data to a Pandas DataFrame.\n\n```python\n# Read file, read the table from file and check schema\nfile = pq.ParquetFile('yellow_tripdata_2023-09.parquet')\ntable = file.read()\ntable.schema\n```\n\n## Converting to Pandas DataFrame\n\nAfter reading the data, we will convert the table into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows us to utilize Pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities, including checking the DataFrame's information and data types.\n\n```python\n# Convert to pandas and check data \ndf = table.to_pandas()\ndf.info()\n```\n\n## Establishing Database Connection\n\nBefore proceeding with inserting data, we need to establish a connection to our PostgreSQL database. This connection will allow us to execute SQL commands directly from Python.\n\n```python\n# Create an open SQL database connection object or a SQLAlchemy connectabl",

              "content": "# Documentation of SQL Queries for NYC Taxi Data Processing\n\nThis document provides a high-level overview of a series of SQL queries aimed at processing and analyzing NYC taxi and bike share data stored in Google BigQuery. The queries include interacting with both public data sets and external CSV datasets stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).\n\n## Querying NYC Citibike Stations\n\nThe initial query retrieves information from a public dataset that contains information about Citibike stations in New York City:\n\n```sql\nSELECT station_id, name FROM\n    bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations\nLIMIT 100;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This query selects the `station_id` and `name` of the first 100 Citibike stations from the `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_stations` table. The result provides a quick reference to the available stations in NYC.\n\n## Creating an External Table\n\nNext, the code defines an external table that references CSV files stored in Google Cloud Storage:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2019-*.csv', 'gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2020-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This command creates an external table named `external_yellow_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi` dataset. This table allows users to query the yellow taxi trip data stored in CSV files directly in GCS without importing them into BigQuery.\n\n## Validating Data from the External Table\n\nThe following query allows users to validate the creation and structure of the external table by retrieving a few records:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata LIMIT 10;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: This query fetches the first 10 records from the `external_yellow_tripdata` table, serving as a sanity check to confirm that the data is accessible and correctly formatted.\n\n## Creating Non-Partitioned Table\n\nFollowing the va",

          "content": "To read large CSV files in chunks using Pandas while processing NYC taxi data, you can use the `pd.read_csv()` function along with the `chunksize` parameter. This allows Pandas to read the CSV file in manageable portions instead of loading the entire dataset into memory at once, which is particularly useful for large datasets.\n\nHere is a basic example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the path to your large CSV file\nfile_path = 'yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv'\n\n# Set the chunk size (number of rows per chunk)\nchunk_size = 100000\n\n# Use a loop to read the CSV file in chunks\nfor chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size):\n    # Process each chunk here\n    # For example, you can convert datetime fields or perform aggregations\n    chunk['tpep_pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(chunk['tpep_pickup_datetime'])\n    chunk['tpep_dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(chunk['tpep_dropoff_datetime'])\n\n    # You can further process the chunk or write it to a database\n    # For demonstration, we'll print the shape of the chunk\n    print(chunk.shape)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `chunksize` parameter allows you to specify how many rows to read at a time. Inside the loop, each `chunk` is a DataFrame of the specified number of rows that you can manipulate as needed.\n\nFor detailed steps on loading data, transforming datetime formats, and processing it iteratively, you can refer to the specific documentation regarding NYC taxi data [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-docker-terraform/2_docker_sql/upload-data.ipynb).",
