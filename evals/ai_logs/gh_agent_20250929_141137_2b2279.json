It leverages the `csv`, `json`, and `kafka` libraries in Python, executing a straightforward process to facilitate the transfer of ride information.\n\n## Libraries and Dependencies\n\nThe script begins with the following imports:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom json import dumps\nfrom kafka import KafkaProducer\nfrom time import sleep\n```\n\n- **csv**: This module is used for reading and parsing CSV files. It allows for ease of access to data structured in rows and columns.\n  \n- **json.dumps**: This function converts Python objects into JSON strings, making it suitable for serializing the data before sending it over Kafka.\n\n- **KafkaProducer**: This class from the `kafka` library is used to send messages to a Kafka broker. The producer will be configured later with serializers for the keys and values.\n\n- **time.sleep**: This function pauses the execution of the script for a specified amount of time, allowing for the control of message flow to the Kafka topic.\n\n## Kafka Producer Initialization\n\nA Kafka producer is initialized with specific configurations:\n\n```python\nproducer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],\n                         key_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8'),\n                         value_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8'))\n```\n\n- **bootstrap_servers**: This parameter specifies the address of the Kafka broker. In this case, it points to a local server running on port 9092.\n\n- **key_serializer**: This lambda function serializes the key into a JSON string format and encodes it in UTF-8. The serialization allows the key to be sent as a uniform message over Kafka.\n\n- **value_serializer**: Similar to the key serializer, this function serializes the value to JSON format and encodes it to ensure compatibility with Kafka message formats.\n\n## CSV File Handling\n\nNext, the script opens the CSV file that ",

The code is designed to consume messages from a Kafka topic, deserialize them into Python objects, and print key-value pairs to the console. Below is a structured breakdown of the code.\n\n## Imports and Dependencies\n\nThe script begins by importing essential libraries:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict, List\nfrom json import loads\nfrom kafka import KafkaConsumer\n\nfrom ride import Ride\nfrom settings import BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS, KAFKA_TOPIC\n```\n\n1. **Standard Libraries**: \n    - `os`: Standard library for interacting with the operating system, though not explicitly used in the code.\n    - `typing`: Provides type hints for better readability and type checking. `Dict` and `List` are imported for type annotations.\n    - `json`: The `loads` function is used to deserialize JSON strings into Python objects.\n  \n2. **Kafka Library**: `KafkaConsumer` is imported from the `kafka` library for consuming messages from Kafka topics.\n\n3. **Local Modules**: \n    - `Ride`: A custom class presumably defined in a separate module, used to deserialize message values.\n    - `settings`: Contains application configuration such as bootstrap servers and Kafka topic names.\n\n## Class Definition: `JsonConsumer`\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `JsonConsumer` class is designed to encapsulate the functionality required to create a Kafka consumer, subscribe to specified topics, and consume messages.\n\n### Constructor\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, props: Dict):\n    self.consumer = KafkaConsumer(**props)\n```\n\n- The constructor initializes the Kafka consumer with properties passed as a `Dict`. This allows for flexible configuration.\n\n### Method: `consume_from_kafka`\n\n```python\ndef consume_from_kafka(self, topics: List[str]):\n```\n\n- This method subscribes to one or more Kafka topics and enters an infinite loop to consume messages continuously.\n\n#### Subscription and Initialization\n\n",

In this case, it points to a local Kafka server running on port 9092. This is the entry point for communication with the Kafka ecosystem.\n\n\n### Kafka Topic\n\n```python\nKAFKA_TOPIC = 'rides_avro'\n```\n\nThis variable defines the Kafka topic named `rides_avro`, where the ride-sharing data will be published and consumed. Topics in Kafka serve as categories or feeds to which records are sent, and they play a critical role in how data is organized and processed.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet serves as a fundamental configuration block for an application that aims to process taxi ride data using Kafka and Avro for serialization. The specified file paths, schema registry URL, bootstrap servers, and Kafka topic provide the necessary parameters for the program to effectively read ride data from a CSV file, validate it against defined schemas, and interact with Kafka's messaging system for data flow.",

It provides methods to send messages to Kafka topics and to read messages from them.\n   - `confluent-kafka`: An alternative library that also supports Kafka, often used for more advanced features and better performance compared to `kafka-python`.\n\n2. **Data Format Handling**:\n   - **CSV**: The `csv` module is used for reading and parsing CSV files.\n   - **JSON**: The `json` module (specifically `json.dumps` for serialization) is utilized to convert Python objects into JSON format before sending them over Kafka.\n   - **Avro**: This format is handled through the `confluent-kafka` library, which supports Avro serialization and can interact with a schema registry.\n\n### Example Libraries in Use\n- **CSV Producer Example**:\n    ```python\n    import csv\n    from json import dumps\n    from kafka import KafkaProducer\n    from time import sleep\n    ```\n   This script reads from a CSV file and sends the data to a Kafka topic, using the Kafka producer.\n\n- **JSON Consumer Example**:\n    ```python\n    from kafka import KafkaConsumer\n    from json import loads\n    ```\n   This script consumes messages from a Kafka topic, deserializing them from JSON.\n\n- **Avro Example**:\n   The use of Avro can be configured while setting up the environment, as indicated in the settings or producer-consumer configurations.\n\n### References\n- For more information regarding stream processing and examples, refer to the [README](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/README.md) file.\n- The CSV and JSON handling within Kafka can specifically be referenced in the scripts found [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/streams-example/faust/producer_taxi_json.py) and [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example/consumer.py).",
