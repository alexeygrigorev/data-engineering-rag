Each record is created with attributes like `ID`, `Name`, `Age`, and `City`.\n\n### Tasks:\n\n1.

          "content": "In DuckDB, when merging data from multiple generators, it's essential to use a primary key to ensure data integrity and properly manage overlapping records. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Setting Up a Primary Key**: You first create a new table in DuckDB with a primary key specified on an identifier field, commonly `ID`. This primary key helps to uniquely identify records and allows DuckDB to handle merges effectively, especially when there are duplicate entries from different datasets.\n\n2. **Merging Process**:\n   - Initially, you load data from the first generator into a specified table. For instance, if you have a generator called `people_1`, you load this into the table and declare the `ID` field as the primary key.\n   - You then append data from a second generator (e.g., `people_2`) into the same table. If there are overlapping `ID`s, DuckDB will replace the existing records with those from the second generator.\n\n3. **Example Code**:\n   You can set up a data loading and merging logic using the `dlt` pipeline, as shown below:\n\n   ```python\n   import dlt\n\n   # Create a DLT pipeline for merging\n   generators_pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='duckdb', dataset_name='people_merge')\n\n   # Load data from the first generator\n   info = generators_pipeline.run(people_1(),\n                                  table_name=\"people_v2\",\n                                  write_disposition=\"replace\",\n                                  primary_key=\"ID\")\n\n   # Load data from the second generator\n   info = generators_pipeline.run(people_2(),\n                                  table_name=\"people_merged\",\n                                  write_disposition=\"merge\",\n                                  primary_key=\"ID\")\n\n   import duckdb\n   \n   # Connect to the DuckDB database\n   conn = duckdb.connect(f\"{generators_pipeline.pipeline_name}.duckdb\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Resulting Behavior**: After running the merge, you can query the merged table to see that the records from the second dataset have replaced those of the first where the `ID`s were the same. This ensures accurate and updated records are maintained in your DuckDB database.\n\nThis structure allows for efficient data merges while managing potential conflicts with overlapping identifiers.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, refer to the notebook containing this content: [homework_solution.ipynb](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/workshops/dlt_resources/homework_solution.ipynb).",
