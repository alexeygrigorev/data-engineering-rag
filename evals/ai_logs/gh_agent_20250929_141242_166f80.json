This includes checking metadata, converting the file to a Pandas DataFrame, generating SQL statements, establishing a database connection, and finally inserting the data into the database. We'll also cover handling both CSV and Parquet files for flexibility.\n\n## Initial Setup \n\nTo begin, we first import the necessary libraries: `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `SQLAlchemy`. These libraries will facilitate reading the Parquet file, manipulating data, and connecting to the SQL database.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd \nimport pyarrow.parquet as pq\nfrom time import time\n```\n\n## Reading Metadata from the Parquet File\n\nNext, we will read the metadata from the specified Parquet file. This step helps us understand the structure and schema of the data without loading it entirely into memory.\n\n```python\n# Read metadata \npq.read_metadata('yellow_tripdata_2023-09.parquet')\n```\n\n## Reading Data and Schema Check\n\nWe will now read the full Parquet file and check its schema. Understanding the schema ensures that we know the data types and structure before converting the data to a Pandas DataFrame.\n\n```python\n# Read file, read the table from file and check schema\nfile = pq.ParquetFile('yellow_tripdata_2023-09.parquet')\ntable = file.read()\ntable.schema\n```\n\n## Converting to Pandas DataFrame\n\nAfter reading the data, we will convert the table into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows us to utilize Pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities, including checking the DataFrame's information and data types.\n\n```python\n# Convert to pandas and check data \ndf = table.to_pandas()\ndf.info()\n```\n\n## Establishing Database Connection\n\nBefore proceeding with inserting data, we need to establish a connection to our PostgreSQL database. This connection will allow us to execute SQL commands directly from Python.\n\n```python\n# Create an open SQL database connection object or a SQLAlchemy connectabl",

              "content": "# PostgreSQL Database Interaction and Data Loading\n\nThis document provides a structured overview of how to interact with a PostgreSQL database using Python and the Pandas library. It includes examples of how to create a database connection, execute SQL queries, and load CSV data into the database.\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\nTo start, you'll need to install some essential packages. The following command installs SQLAlchemy and psycopg2-binary, which are required for database connectivity with PostgreSQL.\n\n```bash\npip install sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary \n```\n\n### Importing Necessary Libraries\n\nAfter installing the required packages, you should import the necessary libraries into your Python script. In this case, we are using the Pandas library for data manipulation and SQLAlchemy to manage the database connections.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n\n## Creating a Database Connection\n\nTo connect to a PostgreSQL database, you can use SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` function. This function constructs a connection string that specifies the database type, user credentials, host, and database name.\n\n```python\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')\n```\n\n### Verifying the Connection\n\nOnce you have created the engine, it's good practice to verify that the connection is successful. This can be done by calling the `connect()` method on the engine object.\n\n```python\nengine.connect()\n```\n\n## Executing Simple SQL Queries\n\nWith an established connection, you can execute SQL queries. \n\n### Example Query: Simple SELECT\n\nThe following SQL query selects a constant value and returns it. It serves as a simple test to check if the database is operational.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSELECT 1 as number;\n\"\"\"\n\npd.read_sql(query, con=engine)\n```\n\n### Querying Database Tables\n\nYou can query the existing tables in your database. The next block retrieves all user-defined tables, excluding system tables.\n\n```python\nquery = \"\"\"\nSEL",

Each section outlines specific steps, along with code examples and explanations.\n\n## Importing Required Libraries\n\nBefore processing the taxi data, it is essential to import the necessary libraries, particularly Pandas for data manipulation. \n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\nTo verify that the correct version of Pandas is installed, you can check the version as follows:\n\n```python\npd.__version__\n```\n\n## Loading Initial Data\n\nIn this section, we read a sample of the NYC taxi trip data from a CSV file. By limiting the rows to 100, we can quickly review the structure of the dataset without exhausting resources.\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv', nrows=100)\n```\n\nNext, we transform the pickup and dropoff datetime columns into a compatible format using Pandas' `to_datetime` method, which allows for easier date-time manipulation later.\n\n```python\ndf.tpep_pickup_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_pickup_datetime)\ndf.tpep_dropoff_datetime = pd.to_datetime(df.tpep_dropoff_datetime)\n```\n\n## Setting Up the Database Connection\n\nTo store the processed data, we need to establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n\nHere, we create an engine with the appropriate connection string pointing to our PostgreSQL database.\n\n```python\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')\n```\n\nWe can then preview the SQL schema that will be generated based on our dataframe's structure.\n\n```python\nprint(pd.io.sql.get_schema(df, name='yellow_taxi_data', con=engine))\n```\n\n## Reading Data in Chunks\n\nFor large datasets, it's often impractical to load everything into memory at once. Instead, we can read data in chunks. Here, we set up an iterator to read the taxi trip data in chunks of 100,000 rows at a tim",

Replace `\"gs://your_bucket_url\"` with your actual bucket URL for it to work properly.\n\n## Installing Packages\n\nTo ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed for both production and testing environments, use the following installation commands.\n\n### Production Installation\n\n```python\n# Install for production\n%%capture\n!pip install dlt[bigquery, gs]\n```\n\n### Testing Installation\n\n```python\n# Install for testing\n%%capture\n!pip install dlt[duckdb]\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe first command installs the dependencies required for cloud integration with BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage, while the second command installs DuckDB, a lightweight database that is often used for local testing. The `%%capture` command captures the output of the installation process and prevents it from cluttering your notebook.\n\n## Importing Necessary Libraries\n\nOnce the packages are installed, import the libraries required for data ingestion and processing.\n\n```python\nimport dlt\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom dlt.destinations import filesystem\nfrom io import BytesIO\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis code imports essential libraries including `dlt` for data pipeline creation, `requests` for HTTP requests, and `pandas` for data manipulation. The `BytesIO` class is used to handle byte data from HTTP responses.\n\n## Ingesting Parquet Files to Google Cloud Storage\n\nThe following code defines a `dlt` source to download Parquet files from a URL, process them, and prepare for ingestion into Google Cloud Storage.\n\n```python\n# Define a dlt source to download and process Parquet files as resources\n@dlt.source(name=\"rides\")\ndef download_parquet():\n     for month in range(1, 7):\n         file_name = f\"yellow_tripdata_2024-0{month}.parquet\"\n         url = f\"https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-0{month}.parquet\"\n         response = requests.get(url)\n         df = pd.read_parquet(BytesIO(response.content))\n         # Return the datafr",

This allows for validation of the schema before actually inserting the data.\n\n```python\n# Generate CREATE SQL statement from schema for validation\nprint(pd.io.sql.get_schema(df, name='yellow_taxi_data', con=engine))\n```\n\n## Inserting Data into Database\n\nWith the connection established and schema validated, we can now focus on inserting the data into the PostgreSQL database. The dataset contains 2,846,722 rows, so we'll process the file in batches of 100,000 rows using the `iter_batches` function. This method is efficient and prevents memory overload.\n\n```python\n# Creating batches of 100,000 for the parquet file\nbatches_iter = file.iter_batches(batch_size=100000)\nbatches_iter\n\n# Take the first batch for te",
