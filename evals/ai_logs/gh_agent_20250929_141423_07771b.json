The class is primarily structured to parse data from a list or a dictionary, encapsulating various attributes that pertain to a ride. The attributes include details such as vendor identification, pickup and dropoff times, passenger count, trip distance, and various fare components.\n\n## Class Definition\n### `Ride` Class\nThe `Ride` class includes multiple methods and attributes that enable the representation and manipulation of ride data.\n\n### Attributes\nThe attributes of the `Ride` class are initialized through the constructor (`__init__`) and include the following:\n\n- `vendor_id`: A string representing the ID of the vendor providing the ride.\n- `tpep_pickup_datetime`: A `datetime` object representing the time the ride was picked up, parsed from a string input.\n- `tpep_dropoff_datetime`: A `datetime` object representing the time the ride was dropped off, also parsed from a string input.\n- `passenger_count`: An integer indicating the number of passengers in the ride.\n- `trip_distance`: A `Decimal` representing the distance of the trip.\n- `rate_code_id`: An integer representing the rate code associated with the ride.\n- `store_and_fwd_flag`: A string indicating whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n- `pu_location_id`: An integer that represents the pickup location ID.\n- `do_location_id`: An integer that represents the dropoff location ID.\n- `payment_type`: A string indicating the method of payment for the ride.\n- `fare_amount`: A `Decimal` representing the fare charged for the ride.\n- `extra`: A `Decimal` indicating any additional charges.\n- `mta_tax`: A `Decimal` representing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax.\n- `tip_amount`: A `Decimal` indicating the tip given for the ride.\n- `tolls_amount`: A `Decimal` representing the total tolls incurred during the ride.\n- `improvement_surcharge`: A `Decimal` indicating any imp",

It encapsulates various attributes related to a taxi ride, such as the vendor ID, pickup and drop-off times, passenger count, trip distance, fare details, and more. This class can be used to create objects that represent individual rides, either from a list of attributes or from a dictionary.\n\n## Class Initialization\n\n### Constructor\n\nThe `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Ride` class. It takes a list of string attributes `arr` that contains all the necessary details for a ride. The attributes are parsed and assigned to instance variables, including:\n\n- **vendor_id**: A string indicative of the vendor providing the service.\n- **tpep_pickup_datetime**: The date and time when the ride was picked up, converted to a `datetime` object.\n- **tpep_dropoff_datetime**: The date and time of ride drop-off, also converted to a `datetime` object.\n- **passenger_count**: The number of passengers in the ride, converted to an integer.\n- **trip_distance**: The distance of the trip, represented as a `Decimal` for precision.\n- **rate_code_id**: An integer representing the rate code applied to the ride.\n- **store_and_fwd_flag**: A flag indicating whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n- **pu_location_id**: The pickup location ID, converted to an integer.\n- **do_location_id**: The drop-off location ID, converted to an integer.\n- **payment_type**: The method of payment used for the trip.\n- **fare_amount**: The base fare amount of the ride, represented as a `Decimal`.\n- **extra**: Any additional charges.\n- **mta_tax**: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax.\n- **tip_amount**: The tip amount provided by the rider.\n- **tolls_amount**: The amount charged for tolls during the trip.\n- **improvement_surcharge**: Charges related to improvements.\n- **total_amount**: The total amount charged for the ride.\n- **congestion_surcharge**: An additional charge related to congestion.",

This representation enables easy inspection of the object's state, making it clearer when printed or logged.\n\n## Data Handling and Types\n\nThe class uses various data types, particularly:\n\n- **Datetime**: For storing date and time values.\n- **Decimal**: For monetary values and distances, ensuring precision during calculations.\n- **Integer and String**: For attributes that are inherently numeric or categorical.\n\nThis careful selection ensures that the data model can handle typical operations without introducing issues related to floating point precision or string handling.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThis class can serve various applications related to taxi services or fleet management systems. By creating instances of `Ride`, developers can manipulate ride data, analyze patterns (like average fare or distance), or prepare reports for ride statistics. This encapsulated data model simplifies the processing of ride data and integrates easily into larger systems.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the `Ride` class is a well-defined structure for managing taxi ride information. It provides mechanisms to create an object from both lists and dictionaries, allowing for flexibility in data ingestion. The representation method enhances usability for debugging and provides a clear view of the object's attributes at any given moment.\n\nDevelopers can build upon this class further by adding methods for processing ride data or implementing custom business logic, such as fare calculations or distance validations, which can extend its functionality effectively.",

This method organizes the data from the dictionary in the same manner as the constructor, and it allows more flexible data handling, like working with JSON-like structures.\n\nThe method constructs and returns a new `Ride` object by extracting values from the dictionary corresponding to each attribute. Each value is chosen carefully to maintain the expected type for that attribute.\n\n## Representation Method\n\n### __repr__ Method\n\nThe `__repr__` method provides a string representation of the `Ride` object. This is helpful for debugging and logging purposes, as it outputs the class name and a dictionary of all the instance variables and their current values.

Below is a summary of the attributes you might include based on the `Ride` class documentation:\n\n### Ride Data Schema\n\n1. **vendor_id**: String - The ID of the vendor providing the ride.\n2. **tpep_pickup_datetime**: Timestamp - The date and time when the ride was picked up.\n3. **tpep_dropoff_datetime**: Timestamp - The date and time when the ride was dropped off.\n4. **passenger_count**: Integer - The number of passengers in the ride.\n5. **trip_distance**: Decimal - The distance of the trip.\n6. **rate_code_id**: Integer - The code for the fare rate applied to the ride.\n7. **store_and_fwd_flag**: String - Indicates whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n8. **pu_location_id**: Integer - The pickup location ID.\n9. **do_location_id**: Integer - The drop-off location ID.\n10. **payment_type**: String - The method of payment used (e.g., cash, credit card).\n11. **fare_amount**: Decimal - The fare charged for the ride.\n12. **extra**: Decimal - Extra fees added to the fare.\n13. **mta_tax**: Decimal - The tax for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n14. **tip_amount**: Decimal - The tip provided by the rider.\n15. **tolls_amount**: Decimal - The amount charged for tolls during the ride.\n16. **improvement_surcharge**: Decimal - A surcharge for improvements.\n17. **total_amount**: Decimal - The total amount charged for the ride.\n\n### Example Spark Schema Definition\nYou can define the above schema in a Spark Structured Streaming application using the `StructType` from `pyspark.sql.types`. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, TimestampType, IntegerType, DecimalType\n\nride_schema = StructType([\n    StructField(\"vendor_id\", StringType(), True),\n    StructField(\"tpep_pickup_datetime\", TimestampType(), True),\n    StructField(\"tpep_dropoff_datetime\", TimestampType(), True),\n    StructField(\"passenger_count\", IntegerType(), True),\n    StructField(\"trip_distance\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"rate_code_id\", IntegerType(), True),\n    StructField(\"store_and_fwd_flag\", StringType(), True),\n    StructField(\"pu_location_id\", IntegerType(), True),\n    StructField(\"do_location_id\", IntegerType(), True),\n    StructField(\"payment_type\", StringType(), True),\n    StructField(\"fare_amount\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"extra\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"mta_tax\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"tip_amount\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"tolls_amount\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"improvement_surcharge\", DecimalType(10, 2), True),\n    StructField(\"total_amount\", DecimalType(10, 2), True)\n])\n```\n\nThis schema can now be used to read and process streaming data corresponding to ride records in your Spark application.
