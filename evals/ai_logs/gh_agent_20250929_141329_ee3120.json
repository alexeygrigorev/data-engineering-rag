This can typically be done by adding a `RUN pip install` command in the Dockerfile. You can also create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the packages you want to install and include it in your Dockerfile.\n\n3. **Sample Dockerfile**:\n   Here's a generic example of what your Dockerfile might look like:\n\n   ```Dockerfile\n   FROM apache/airflow:2.2.3\n\n   # Install custom packages\n   COPY requirements.txt .\n   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n4. **Docker Compose Updates**: After modifying your Dockerfile, make sure to update your `docker-compose.yaml` file to specify the build context pointing to your Dockerfile instead of the image tag. For example:\n   \n   ```yaml\n   x-airflow-common:\n     build:\n       context: .\n       dockerfile: Dockerfile\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to include your custom Python packages in your Airflow instance using Docker.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the full guide in the documentation: [Setting up Airflow with Docker](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/1_setup_official.md).",
