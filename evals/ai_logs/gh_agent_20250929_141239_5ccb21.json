It provides defined constructors to create instances of the class, facilitating both parameterized and default object creation.\n\n## Properties\n\n### VendorID (String)\n- **Description**: Represents a unique identifier for the vendor. It is stored as a `String` to accommodate potential alphanumeric vendor IDs.\n  \n### PULocationID (long)\n- **Description**: Indicates the pickup location ID for the vendor, stored as a numerical value (long). This allows for the reference of specific locations tied to the vendor's service area.\n\n### pickupTime (LocalDateTime)\n- **Description**: Captures the time at which a vendor picks up a customer or an item.

The `join` uses a `ValueJoiner` that checks if the difference between the drop-off and pickup times is within 10 minutes.\n   - If the condition is met, a new `VendorInfo` instance is created, containing the ride and location information.\n\n4. **Windowing**: The joining operation uses a time window of 20 minutes and a grace period of 5 minutes.\n\n5. **Filtering and Output**: After the join, the resulting stream is filtered to exclude any `Optional` values that are empty.

An instance of `JsonKStreamJoins` is created.\n2. The `joinRidesPickupLocation` method is called, starting the stream processing.\n\nThis encapsulative flow is typical in Kafka Streams applications, where application logic is housed in specific classes, and the main method initializes the execution context.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `JsonKStreamJoins` class exemplifies the use of Kafka Streams for real-time data processing by joining ride data with pickup location data.

It leverages the Kafka Streams library to create a topology that evaluates the interaction between different data streams. The class utilizes the JUnit framework for unit testing, particularly focusing on the joins involving ride and location data.\n\n## Dependencies and Class Structure\nThis class imports essential components from the Kafka Streams library, including `StreamsConfig`, `Topology`, and various serialization classes. It also imports custom serialization/deserialization (`CustomSerdes`) and data classes (`Ride`, `PickupLocation`, `VendorInfo`) used in the streaming operations. The test class is structured around the JUnit testing lifecycle, including setup and teardown functionalities.\n\n## Properties and Topology Setup\n### Properties Configuration\nThe `props` property object is defined to configure the Kafka Streams application. Specifically, it sets the application ID and bootstrap server properties. This configuration is crucial for correctly running the Streams application in a testing environment, allowing it to connect to the appropriate Kafka cluster.\n\n### Topology Creation\nAn instance of `Topology` is created by calling `createTopology()` from the `JsonKStreamJoins` class. This method presumably constructs and configures the necessary steps for processing incoming stream data from rides and pickup locations.\n\n## Test Initialization\n### Test Driver\nThe `TopologyTestDriver` is initialized in the `setup()` method. This driver simulates the processing of data through the created topology, allowing the test to send input data through the streams and to observe the output. \n\n### Topics Definition\nThree test topics are created:\n1. **Input Rides Topic**: A topic for incoming ride data.\n2. **Input Pickup Location Topic**: A topic for inco",
