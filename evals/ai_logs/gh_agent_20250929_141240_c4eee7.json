It efficiently processes data while **keeping memory usage low** and **leveraging parallelism** for better performance.\n\n### **Extracting data with dlt**\n\nExtracting data from APIs manually requires handling\n- **pagination**,\n- **rate limits**,\n- **authentication**,\n- **errors**.\n\nInstead of writing custom scripts, **[dlt](https://dlthub.com/)** simplifies the process with a built-in **[REST API Client](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/http/rest-client)**, making extraction **efficient, scalable, and reliable**.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why use dlt for extraction?**  \n\n\u2705 **Built-in REST API support** \u2013 Extract data from APIs with minimal code.  \n\u2705 **Automatic pagination handling** \u2013 No need to loop through pages manually.  \n\u2705 **Manages Rate Limits & Retries** \u2013 Prevents exceeding API limits and handles failures.  \n\u2705 **Streaming support** \u2013 Extracts and processes data without loading everything into memory.  \n\u2705 **Seamless integration** \u2013 Works with **normalization and loading** in a single pipeline.  \n\n![dlt](img/dlt.png)\n\n### **Install dlt**\n\n[Install](https://dlthub.com/docs/reference/installation) dlt with DuckDB as destination:\n\n```shell\npip install dlt[duckdb]\n```\n\n### **Example of extracting data with dlt**  \n\nInstead of manually writing pagination logic, let\u2019s use **dlt\u2019s [`RESTClient` helper](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/http/rest-client)** to extract NYC taxi ride data:  \n```py\nimport dlt\nfrom dlt.",

For this assignment, we\u2019ll still do a quick test with DuckDB.\n\n2. **Check** the version:\n\n```\n!dlt --version\n```\n\nor:\n\n```py\nimport dlt\nprint(\"dlt version:\", dlt.__version__)\n```\n\nProvide the **version** you see in the output.\n\n## **Question 2: Define & Run the Pipeline (NYC Taxi API)**\n\nUse dlt to extract all pages of data from the API.\n\nSteps:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Use the `@dlt.resource` decorator to define the API source.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Implement automatic pagination using dlt's built-in REST client.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Load the extracted data into DuckDB for querying.\n\n```py\nimport dlt\nfrom dlt.sources.helpers.rest_client import RESTClient\nfrom dlt.sources.helpers.rest_client.paginators import PageNumberPaginator\n\n\n# your code is here\n\n\npipeline = dlt.pipeline(\n    pipeline_name=\"ny_taxi_pipeline\",\n    destination=\"duckdb\",\n    dataset_name=\"ny_taxi_data\"\n)\n```\n\nLoad the data into DuckDB to test:\n```py\nload_info = pipeline.run(ny_taxi)\nprint(load_info)\n```\nStart a connection to your database using native `duckdb` connection and look what tables were generated:\"\"\"\n\n```py\nimport duckdb\nfrom google.colab import data_table\ndata_table.enable_dataframe_formatter()\n\n# A database '<pipeline_name>.duckdb' was created in working directory so just connect to it\n\n# Connect to the DuckDB database\nconn = duckdb.connect(f\"{pipeline.pipeline_na",

You can comment in the BigQuery line to switch to production mode. The run command, followed by printing the information, confirms the ingestion process.\n\n## Analyzing Data with DuckDB\n\nOnce the data has been loaded into DuckDB, you might want to inspect the dataset and perform basic queries.\n\n```python\nimport duckdb\nconn = duckdb.connect(f\"{pipeline.pipeline_name}.duckdb\")\n\n# Set search path to the dataset\nconn.sql(f\"SET search_path = '{pipeline.dataset_name}'\")\n\n# Describe the dataset to see loaded tables\nres = conn.sql(\"DESCRIBE\").df()\nprint(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThis section establishes a connection to the DuckDB instance created during the pipeline process. It sets the search path to the dataset name you've provided and executes a SQL `DESCRIBE` command to list the tables loaded into the database. Finally, it prints out the result set, which gives you a clear understanding of the internal structure of your data.\n\n## Querying the Data\n\nTo extract specific metrics or insights from the dataset, you can perform SQL queries within your DuckDB connection.\n\n```python\n# Provide a resource name to query a table of that name\nwith pipeline.sql_client() as client:\n    with client.execute_query(f\"SELECT count(1) FROM rides\") as cursor:\n        data = cursor.df()\nprint(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nIn this final block, a context manager is used to interact with the SQL client associated with the pipeline. A SQL command is executed to count the number of records in the `rides` table, and this count is printed out. This is a simple yet effective way to validate the success of your data ingestion pipeline.",

The typical answer to the question about how many tables were created will depend on the specific implementation and the data provided in the API [source](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2025/workshops/dlt/dlt_homework.md).\n\nIf you need more detailed insights or specific query examples to count tables, refer to the sections where SQL queries are used to interact with DuckDB.",
