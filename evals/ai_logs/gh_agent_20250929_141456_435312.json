They provide scalable storage solutions that integrate well with their respective cloud platforms.\n\n2. **File Systems**: Distributed file systems like Apache Cassandra or GlusterFS can be utilized to manage data in a way similar to HDFS, providing high availability and scalability.\n\n3. **Modern Data Lake Storage Layers**: Technologies like Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Hudi are designed for data lakes and offer features like ACID transactions and schema evolution, enhancing traditional formats.\n\n4. **Database Solutions**: Some organizations choose to leverage data warehouses, such as Snowflake or Google BigQuery, which can function as data lakes for certain use cases, especially when considering data integration and analytics capabilities.\n\n5. **On-Premises Solutions**: Building custom data lake infrastructure using enterprise storage solutions can also be an option, providing full control over the data management processes.\n\nFor more insights on modern data lake technologies, you might find the blog posts mentioned in the documentation useful, such as \"An Introduction to Modern Data Lake Storage Layers\" which discusses various storage options beyond traditional systems.\n\nYou can find more details and references in the following source: [awesome-data-engineering.md](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/awesome-data-engineering.md).",
