Pre-requisites\n\nIf you have been following the [module-06](./../../../06-streaming/README.md) videos, you might already have installed the `kafka-python` library, so you can move on to [Docker](#2-docker) section.\n\nIf you have not, this is the only package you need to install in your virtual environment for this Redpanda lesson. \n\n1. activate your environment\n2. `pip install kafka-python`\n\n## 2. Docker\n\nStart a Redpanda cluster. Redpanda is a single binary image, so it is very easy to start learning kafka concepts with Redpanda.\n\n```bash\ncd 06-streaming/python/redpanda_example/\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n## 3. Set RPK alias\n\nRedpanda has a console command `rpk` which means `Redpanda keeper`, the CLI tool that ships with Redpanda and is already available in the Docker image. \n\nSet the following `rpk` alias so we can use it from our terminal, without having to open a Docker interactive terminal. We can use this `rpk` alias directly in our terminal. \n\n```bash\nalias rpk=\"docker exec -ti redpanda-1 rpk\"\nrpk version\n```\n\nAt this time, the verion is shown as `v23.2.26 (rev 328d83a06e)`. The important version munber is the major one `v23` following the versioning semantics `major.minor[.build[.revision]]`, to ensure that you get the same results as whatever is shared in this document.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you're reading this after Mar, 2024 and want to update the Docker file to use the latest Redpanda images, just visit [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/vectorized/redpanda/tags), and paste the new version number.\n\n\n## 4.

This repository should contain your code for solving the homework. If your solution includes code that is not in file format (such as SQL queries or shell commands), please include these directly in the README file of your repository.\n\n## Docker & SQL\n\nIn this homework we'll prepare the environment \nand practice with Docker and SQL\n\n\n## Question 1. Knowing docker tags\n\nRun the command to get information on Docker \n\n```docker --help```\n\nNow run the command to get help on the \"docker build\" command:\n\n```docker build --help```\n\nDo the same for \"docker run\".\n\nWhich tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* \n\n- `--delete`\n- `--rc`\n- `--rmc`\n- `--rm`\n\n\n## Question 2. Understanding docker first run \n\nRun docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.\nNow check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). \n\nWhat is version of the package *wheel* ?\n\n- 0.42.0\n- 1.0.0\n- 23.0.1\n- 58.1.0\n\n\n# Prepare Postgres\n\nRun Postgres and load data as shown in the videos\nWe'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:\n\n```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz```\n\nYou will also need the dataset with zones:\n\n```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```\n\nDownload this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)\n\n\n## Question 3. Count records \n\nHow many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?\n\nTip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. \n\nRemember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.\n\n- 15767\n- 15612\n- 15859\n- 89009\n\n## Question 4.
