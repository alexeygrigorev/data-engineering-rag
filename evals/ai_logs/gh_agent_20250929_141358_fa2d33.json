I've outlined the steps for macOS, Windows, and Linux below:\n\n### For macOS\n\n1. **Install Java**:\n   Ensure you have Homebrew installed, then install Java:\n   ```bash\n   brew install java\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Apache Spark**:\n   Using Homebrew, install Apache Spark:\n   ```bash\n   brew install apache-spark\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   Add the following lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` to set the necessary environment variables:\n   ```bash\n   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/openjdk@11/11.0.12 # Adjust if needed\n   export PATH=\"$JAVA_HOME/bin/:$PATH\"\n   export SPARK_HOME=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.5.5/libexec # Adjust if needed\n   export PATH=\"$SPARK_HOME/bin/:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Test Spark Setup**:\n   Open Jupyter Lab and run the following code to verify the installation:\n   ```python\n   import pyspark\n   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n   spark = SparkSession.builder.master(\"local[1]\").appName('test-spark').getOrCreate()\n   print(f'The PySpark {spark.version} version is running...')\n   ```\n\n### For Windows\n\n1. **Install Java**:\n   Download and install the Java JDK, ensuring it is on your PATH.\n\n2. **Download Spark**:\n   Download Spark version 3.3.2 from the Apache Spark download site, and unpack it to a folder without spaces, e.g., `C:/tools/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3`.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   Add the following to your `PATH`:\n   ```bash\n   export JAVA_HOME=\"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-11\" # Adjust if needed\n   export SPARK_HOME=\"C:/tools/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3\"\n   export PATH=\"${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Test Spark Setup**:\n   Open a command prompt, navigate to the Spark directory, and run:\n   ```bash\n   .\\bin\\spark-shell.cmd\n   val data = 1 to 10000\n   val distData = sc.parallelize(data)\n   distData.filter(_ < 10).collect()\n   ```\n\n### For Linux\n\n1. **Install Java**:\n   Download OpenJDK 11:\n   ```bash\n   wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk11/9/GPL/openjdk-11.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz\n   tar xzfv openjdk-11.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz\n   export JAVA_HOME=\"${HOME}/spark/jdk-11.0.2\"\n   export PATH=\"${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Spark**:\n   Download and unpack Spark:\n   ```bash\n   wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz\n   tar xzfv spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz\n   export SPARK_HOME=\"${HOME}/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3\"\n   export PATH=\"${SPARK_HOME}/bin:${PATH}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Test Spark Setup**:\n   Run the Spark shell:\n   ```bash\n   spark-shell\n   val data = 1 to 10000\n   val distData = sc.parallelize(data)\n   distData.filter(_ < 10).collect()\n   ```\n\n### Summary\nBy following the steps above according to your operating system, you will have successfully set up the Spark environment. Make sure to replace any paths with those specific to your installation. \n\nFor more detailed instructions, you may refer to the corresponding setup files in the course materials:\n- [macOS Setup](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/setup/macos.md)\n- [Windows Setup](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/setup/windows.md)\n- [Linux Setup](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/setup/linux.md)",
