The DAG includes tasks for downloading the dataset from a remote URL and uploading it to a specified GCS bucket.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe DAG is designed to run daily (`@daily`), ensuring that it fetches the most up-to-date dataset each day. It orchestrates two main tasks:\n\n1. **Downloading the Dataset**: Retrieves a CSV file containing trip data.\n2. **Uploading to Google Cloud Storage**: Transfers the downloaded file to a specified GCS bucket.\n\nThe workflow is structured to ensure that the upload task only begins after the download task completes successfully. This is indicated by the task dependency defined at the end of the DAG.\n\n## Environment Configuration\n\nThe script starts by importing necessary modules, including:\n\n- `os`: For accessing environment variables.\n- `datetime`: To handle date-related operations.\n- `airflow`: The core libraries for creating and managing the DAG.\n- `google.cloud.storage`: For interacting with Google Cloud Storage.\n\nSeveral environment variables are retrieved, allowing for configuration flexibility without hardcoding values. These include:\n\n- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The Google Cloud project ID (default value set).\n- `GCP_GCS_BUCKET`: The name of the GCS bucket for uploading the data.\n- `AIRFLOW_HOME`: The directory for Airflow home settings.\n\nA URL for the dataset and a local file path for downloads are constructed using these environment variables.\n\n## DAG Definition\n\nA `DAG` instance is created with specific configurations:\n\n- **dag_id**: Unique identifier for the DAG (`data_ingestion_gcs_dag`).\n- **schedule_interval**: Set to run daily.\n- **default_args**: Includes common parameters like the owner, start date, and retry settings.\n- **catchup**: Allows the DAG to run for past d",

The script performs a series of tasks that transfer, create, and process datasets related to trip data.\n\n## Environment Variables and Constants\n\nThe script pulls several configurations from environment variables, which allows for dynamic setup based on deployment in different environments. The key constants used in the script are:\n\n- **PROJECT_ID**: The Google Cloud project ID.\n- **BUCKET**: The GCS bucket name where data files are stored.\n- **path_to_local_home**: The directory where Airflow is expected to be running, defaulting to `/opt/airflow/`.\n- **BIGQUERY_DATASET**: The BigQuery dataset name, with a default value of 'trips_data_all'.\n- **DATASET**: A constant string set to \"tripdata\", representing the dataset's name.\n- **COLOUR_RANGE**: A dictionary mapping the color of the trip data to their respective datetime columns used for partitioning.\n- **INPUT_PART**: The path where raw input files are located, set as \"raw\".\n- **INPUT_FILETYPE**: The file type of the data being processed, specifically \"parquet\".\n\n## DAG Configuration\n\nThe DAG is created with specific properties and configurations that manage how the tasks are executed:\n\n- **dag_id**: The identifier for the DAG is \"gcs_2_bq_dag\".\n- **schedule_interval**: This DAG is scheduled to run daily.\n- **default_args**: A dictionary containing default arguments such as the owner, start date, and retry configurations.\n- **catchup**: Set to `False`, meaning the DAG will not attempt to catch up on missed schedules.\n- **max_active_runs**: Limited to 1, ensuring that concurrent runs do not occur.\n- **tags**: A way to categorize the DAG for easier identification, here tagged as 'dtc-de'.\n\n## Task Definitions\n\nThe script defines multiple tasks using a loop that iterates over the `COLOUR_RANG",

          "content": "A **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** in Apache Airflow is a fundamental concept that represents a collection of tasks and their dependencies. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what a DAG is and why it is important:\n\n### Definition of a DAG\n- **Directed**: Each task in the DAG points to the next task(s) it depends on, establishing a clear direction of flow.\n- **Acyclic**: The graph does not contain cycles, meaning you cannot return to a previous task once you've moved on to the next task. This ensures that each task is executed once per run.\n\n### Importance of a DAG\n1. **Task Management**: A DAG specifies the order in which tasks should be executed, which is crucial in ensuring that dependencies are respected. For instance, a task that processes data must only run after the task that ingests the data has completed successfully.\n\n2. **Clear Execution Plan**: By defining a DAG, you create a clear and visual representation of the workflow. This makes it easier to understand, manage, and debug the data pipeline.\n\n3. **Scheduling**: DAGs can be scheduled to run automatically at defined intervals, enabling automated data processing and ingestion without human intervention.\n\n4. **State Tracking**: Each DAG run maintains the state of tasks, allowing you to monitor which tasks succeeded, failed, or are still running. This is essential for maintaining the reliability and observability of data workflows.\n\n5. **Reusability**: DAG definitions can be reused and parameterized, allowing you to create flexible workflows that can adapt to different datasets or computing environments.\n\n### Components of a DAG\n- **Tasks**: These are the individual units of work within the DAG. Each task is often represented by operators in Airflow, such as those that extract, transform, or load data.\n- **Task Dependencies**: These define the order of execution through operators like `>>` (set downstream) and `<<` (set upstream).\n\nIn summary, a DAG is central to workflows in Apache Airflow, ensuring that tasks are executed in a proper sequence with corresponding dependencies managed effectively, which is essential for building robust data pipelines.\n\nFor more details on DAGs and their structure in Airflow, refer to the following source: [1_concepts.md](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/docs/1_concepts.md).",
