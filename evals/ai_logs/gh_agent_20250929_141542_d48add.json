Here\u2019s a compilation:\n\n### Kaggle Datasets\nKaggle hosts a diverse range of datasets that can be leveraged for data engineering projects. You can explore all available datasets through their [Kaggle Datasets Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).\n\n### AWS Datasets\nAWS also provides a rich selection of datasets, which can be found in the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/). These datasets cover various domains, making them useful for different data engineering applications.\n\n### Other Notable Datasets\nBesides Kaggle and AWS, here are other datasets you might find useful:\n- UK Government Open Data: [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/)\n- GitHub Archive: [gharchive.org](https://www.gharchive.org)\n- Million Songs Dataset: [millionsongdataset.com](http://millionsongdataset.com)\n- Common Crawl: [commoncrawl.org](https://commoncrawl.org/) (a web archive)\n- NASA's EarthData: [earthdata.nasa.gov](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search) (requires some geospatial analysis knowledge)\n\nFeel free to use any dataset from these resources, depending on your project needs. There's a wide variety of data available, which will allow you to explore different aspects of data engineering.\n\nFor further information, you can refer to the documentation on datasets available [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/projects/datasets.md).",
