The attributes include details such as vendor identification, pickup and dropoff times, passenger count, trip distance, and various fare components.\n\n## Class Definition\n### `Ride` Class\nThe `Ride` class includes multiple methods and attributes that enable the representation and manipulation of ride data.\n\n### Attributes\nThe attributes of the `Ride` class are initialized through the constructor (`__init__`) and include the following:\n\n- `vendor_id`: A string representing the ID of the vendor providing the ride.\n- `tpep_pickup_datetime`: A `datetime` object representing the time the ride was picked up, parsed from a string input.\n- `tpep_dropoff_datetime`: A `datetime` object representing the time the ride was dropped off, also parsed from a string input.\n- `passenger_count`: An integer indicating the number of passengers in the ride.\n- `trip_distance`: A `Decimal` representing the distance of the trip.\n- `rate_code_id`: An integer representing the rate code associated with the ride.\n- `store_and_fwd_flag`: A string indicating whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n- `pu_location_id`: An integer that represents the pickup location ID.\n- `do_location_id`: An integer that represents the dropoff location ID.\n- `payment_type`: A string indicating the method of payment for the ride.\n- `fare_amount`: A `Decimal` representing the fare charged for the ride.\n- `extra`: A `Decimal` indicating any additional charges.\n- `mta_tax`: A `Decimal` representing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax.\n- `tip_amount`: A `Decimal` indicating the tip given for the ride.\n- `tolls_amount`: A `Decimal` representing the total tolls incurred during the ride.\n- `improvement_surcharge`: A `Decimal` indicating any imp",

For example, ride-hailing services can utilize instances of this class to track ride data, compute earnings, manage driver and vehicle statistics, and generate analytics for business needs.\n\nIn summary, the `Ride` class serves as a foundational data structure that enables organized handling of detailed information regarding taxi rides, capturing essential data that can be processed or analyzed as per the application's requirements.",

The `datetime.strptime` function is utilized to convert pickup and dropoff datetime strings into `datetime` objects, while other attributes are cast to their respective types.\n\n## Class Method\n### `from_dict(cls, d: Dict)`\nThis class method provides an alternative way to create an instance of the `Ride` class from a dictionary. It extracts the required values from the dictionary, ensuring they are presented in the format expected by the constructor (`__init__`). The method uses the keys from the input dictionary to build a list, which it then passes to the constructor.\n\n## Representation Method\n### `__repr__(self)`\nThe `__repr__` method is defined to provide a clear textual representation of the `Ride` object, outputting the class name and its current state (i.e., the attribute dictionary). This is particularly useful for debugging, as it allows easy inspection of the object\u2019s attributes.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `Ride` class is an efficient structure for managing ride-hailing trip data, encapsulating relevant attributes, and providing methods for instantiation from both lists and dictionaries. Its design facilitates easy onboarding of data into the system, ensuring robust type handling and clear representations for usage and debugging. Overall, this class serves as a critical component for applications that require ride data management, such as analytics, reporting, or real-time processing.",

Instead of passing a list, it takes a dictionary `d` where keys correspond to the attributes of the `Ride` class. This method organizes the data from the dictionary in the same manner as the constructor, and it allows more flexible data handling, like working with JSON-like structures.\n\nThe method constructs and returns a new `Ride` object by extracting values from the dictionary corresponding to each attribute. Each value is chosen carefully to maintain the expected type for that attribute.\n\n## Representation Method\n\n### __repr__ Method\n\nThe `__repr__` method provides a string representation of the `Ride` object. This is helpful for debugging and logging purposes, as it outputs the class name and a dictionary of all the instance variables and their current values. This representation enables easy inspection of the object's state, making it clearer when printed or logged.\n\n## Data Handling and Types\n\nThe class uses various data types, particularly:\n\n- **Datetime**: For storing date and time values.\n- **Decimal**: For monetary values and distances, ensuring precision during calculations.\n- **Integer and String**: For attributes that are inherently numeric or categorical.\n\nThis careful selection ensures that the data model can handle typical operations without introducing issues related to floating point precision or string handling.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThis class can serve various applications related to taxi services or fleet management systems. By creating instances of `Ride`, developers can manipulate ride data, analyze patterns (like average fare or distance), or prepare reports for ride statistics. This encapsulated data model simplifies the processing of ride data and integrates easily into larger systems.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the `",

          "content": "The `JsonProducer` class reads data from a CSV file and transforms it into `Ride` objects through its method `getRides()`. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how this process works:\n\n1. **Accessing the CSV file**: The `getRides()` method accesses the `rides.csv` file, which is located in the classpath.\n   \n   ```java\n   var ridesStream = this.getClass().getResource(\"/rides.csv\");\n   ```\n\n2. **Reading the CSV file**: Using the `CSVReader` from the OpenCSV library, the method reads the file while skipping the header row.\n\n   ```java\n   var reader = new CSVReader(new FileReader(ridesStream.getFile()));\n   reader.skip(1);\n   ```\n\n3. **Mapping each row to Ride objects**: The method maps each row of data into a `Ride` object by using a stream that applies the `Ride` constructor to each row array. This means each row from the CSV is transformed into a `Ride` object.\n\n   ```java\n   return reader.readAll().stream().map(arr -> new Ride(arr)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n   ```\n\nThe `Ride` constructor takes an array of strings and initializes an instance of `Ride` with the values corresponding to its attributes, converting types as necessary (for instance, converting datetime strings into `LocalDateTime` objects, and other values into appropriate types such as `Integer` or `Decimal`).\n\nThis class is integral to the workflow of transforming raw ride data into structured `Ride` objects that can then be processed or published, for instance, to a Kafka topic, as demonstrated in the `publishRides(List<Ride> rides)` method.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the source code here: [JsonProducer.java](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java) and [Ride.py](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/json_example/ride.py).",
