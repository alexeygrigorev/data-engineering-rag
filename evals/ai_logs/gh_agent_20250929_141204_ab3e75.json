It leverages the Kafka Streams API to perform the joining operation and outputs the results to a designated Kafka topic. The implementation focuses on ensuring that the data is only combined under certain temporal conditions, using custom serializers and handling exceptions robustly.\n\n## Properties Configuration\n\n### Kafka Streams Configuration\n\nThe constructor of the `JsonKStreamJoins` class initializes a set of properties necessary for connecting to a Kafka cluster:\n\n- **Bootstrap Servers**: Points to the Kafka broker (`pkc-75m1o.europe-west3.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092`).\n- **Security Protocol**: Configured to use `SASL_SSL`.\n- **Authentication**: Uses JAAS for authentication, where the username and password are fetched from a `Secrets` class.\n- **Client Configuration**: Various settings, such as DNS lookup strategies and session timeout.\n- **Application ID**: Uniquely identifies the Kafka Streams application.\n- **Offset Reset Policy**: Configured to read the latest messages if no offsets are found.\n- **Buffering Configuration**: Set to disable the maximum bytes buffering.\n\n## Topology Creation\n\n### Stream Processing\n\nThe `createTopology` method is responsible for defining the data flow for the Kafka Streams application:\n\n1. **Stream Sources**: It creates two input streams:\n   - `rides`: Processes data from the `INPUT_RIDE_TOPIC`, deserialized into `Ride` objects using a custom serializer.\n   - `pickupLocations`: Processes data from the `INPUT_RIDE_LOCATION_TOPIC`, deserialized into `PickupLocation` objects.\n\n2. **Key Selection**: The `pickupLocations` stream is then re-keyed based on the `PULocationID`, which is intended for joining with rides.\n\n3. **Joining Streams**: \n   - A join operation between `rides` and `pickupLocationsKeyedOnPUId` is established. The `join` uses a `ValueJo",

          "content": "In the `joinRidesPickupLocation` method of the `JsonKStreamJoins` class, exception handling is carefully configured to manage errors that may arise during the Kafka Streams lifecycle. Here are the key points regarding how exceptions are handled:\n\n1. **Uncaught Exception Handling**: The method sets an uncaught exception handler for the `KafkaStreams` instance. This handler is responsible for logging any exceptions that occur during stream processing. If any unhandled exceptions are encountered, this handler ensures that the application can shut down gracefully.\n\n2. **Stream Initialization and State Checking**: The stream is started, and the application enters a loop to check the state of the stream until it transitions to the `RUNNING` state. This process includes exception handling to manage any issues that might prevent the stream from starting correctly.\n\n3. **Shutdown Hook**: A shutdown hook is added, which ensures that the Kafka stream is properly closed when the application terminates, further aiding in preventing resource leaks and ensuring clean-up in case of errors.\n\nOverall, the integration of structured exception handling in `joinRidesPickupLocation` ensures that the application can handle failures effectively while maintaining the integrity of the stream processing.\n\nFor more detailed information on this class and method, you can refer to the source code [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonKStreamJoins.java).",
