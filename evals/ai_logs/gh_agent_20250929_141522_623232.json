Specifically, it counts the occurrences of records in the `rides` topic based on their keys and publishes these counts to the `rides-pulocation-count` topic. The application makes use of Apache Kafka for its pub-sub messaging capabilities and streams processing.\n\n## Configuration Properties\n\n### Kafka Streams Configuration\n\nIn the constructor of the `JsonKStream` class, various properties are defined to configure the Kafka Streams application. These properties include:\n\n- **Bootstrap Servers**: Specifies the Kafka broker addresses.\n- **Security Protocol**: Configured to use secure connections (SASL_SSL).\n- **JAAS Configuration**: Contains the credentials (username and password) for connecting to the Kafka cluster using the `PlainLoginModule`.\n- **Client DNS Lookup**: Set to use all DNS IPs for better resilience in service discovery.\n- **Session Timeout**: Configured to define the session expiration time.\n- **Application ID**: Identifies the Kafka Streams application.\n- **Auto Offset Reset**: Specifies behavior for consumers when there is no initial offset.\n- **Cache Size**: Set to zero, indicating that no caching is used for the stream processing.\n\nThis configuration is crucial for setting up the Kafka Streams environment and ensuring secure communication with the Kafka cluster.\n\n## Topology Creation\n\nThe `createTopology()` method is responsible for defining the processing logic for the Kafka Streams application. It does the following:\n\n1. **StreamsBuilder Initialization**: A `StreamsBuilder` instance is created to facilitate the definition of stream processing logic.\n2. **Stream Ingestion**: The application subscribes to the `rides` topic, specifying that it expects key-value pairs where the key is a `String` and the value is a custom serialized `Ride` obje",

It performs the following:\n\n1. **Object Instantiation**: A new instance of `JsonKStream` is created.\n2. **Count Initialization**: It invokes the `countPLocation()` method, initiating the Kafka Streams processing.\n\nThe main method effectively kick-starts the application's execution in a straightforward way.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe class relies on several libraries and frameworks:\n\n- **Apache Kafka**: For streaming and handling pub-sub messaging.\n- **Custom Serializers/Deserializers**: It mentions a custom `CustomSerdes` class, which presumably handles the serialization/deserialization of the `Ride` objects.\n- **Data Class**: Uses a `Ride` class, which is expected to represent the data structure of the incoming messages.\n\nBy using these dependencies, the application leverages powerful data processing capabilities provided by the Kafka ecosystem.\n\n## Exception Handling\n\nThe `countPLocation` method is declared to throw `InterruptedException`, indicating that thread interruptions are anticipated during sleep or state checking. This also implies that the invoking method will need to handle such exceptions appropriately, ensuring stability in the thread management of this Kafka Streams application.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `JsonKStream` class exemplifies a basic yet effective Kafka Streams application, managing the ingestion, processing, and output of streaming data. By leveraging Apache Kafka's robust stream processing capabilities, it performs key-based counting of ride events, making ",
