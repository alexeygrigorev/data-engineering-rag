It also demonstrates how to download a dataset for analysis and the subsequent steps to read, display, and save the data.\n\n## Importing the PySpark Library\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\n```\n\nIn this code block, the `pyspark` library is imported, which is essential for working with Apache Spark in a Python environment. PySpark allows users to leverage Spark's distributed computing capabilities directly from Python.\n\n## Verifying PySpark Installation\n\n```python\npyspark.__file__\n```\n\nThis command checks and retrieves the file path of the installed PySpark library. It can be helpful for confirming that PySpark has been set up correctly in your Python environment.\n\n## Creating a Spark Session\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nHere, the `SparkSession` class is imported from `pyspark.sql`, which serves as the entry point for working with DataFrames and executing Spark SQL queries. The session is initialized with the following configurations:\n- `.master(\"local[*]\")`: This indicates that Spark should run locally with as many worker threads as there are logical cores on the machine. \n- `.appName('test')`: This sets the name of the Spark application; it can be useful for monitoring and debugging.\n- `.getOrCreate()`: This method either retrieves an existing SparkSession or creates a new one.\n\n## Downloading a Dataset\n\n```python\n!wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv\n```\n\nThis code uses the `wget` command to download a CSV file containing taxi zone lookup information from a public URL. Using the command shell via the exclamation mark (`!`) allows executing shell commands within a Jupyter notebook.\n\n## Inspecting the Downloaded File\n\n```python\n!head taxi+_zone_lookup.csv\n```\n",

The data used in this example concerns taxi trips in New York City.\n\n## Setting Up PySpark\n\nTo begin, we need to import the required libraries and initialize a Spark session. The Spark session acts as an entry point for working with Spark.\n\n```python\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n```\n\nHere, we import `pyspark` and create a `SparkSession` named 'test'. The `master(\"local[*]\")` configuration indicates that Spark will run locally using as many threads as available.\n\n## Downloading the Dataset\n\nNext, we will download the required dataset, which contains records of New York City taxi trips. The data is stored in a compressed CSV format.\n\n```python\n!wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/fhvhv/fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\n```\n\nUsing the `wget` command, we fetch the compressed CSV file from the specified URL.\n\n## Unpacking and Inspecting the Data\n\nOnce we have the data, it's essential to unpack the compressed file and inspect the number of lines it contains to understand its size.\n\n```python\n!gzip -dc fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz\n```\n\nThis command decompresses the CSV file for us to view the contents.\n\n```python\n!wc -l fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.csv\n```\n\nThe `wc -l` command counts the lines in the CSV file, giving us an estimate of the dataset size.\n\n## Loading Data into Spark\n\nNow we can load the CSV file into a Spark DataFrame. We use the `read.csv()` method with an option to treat the first row as headers.\n\n```python\ndf = spark.read \\\n    .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\\n    .csv('fhvhv_tripdata_2021-01.csv')\n```\n\nThis code reads the CSV file and creates a Spark DataFrame named `df`, which allows for powerful data manipulation and analysis using Spark.\n\n## Ex",

              "content": "# Code Documentation\n\n## Overview\n\nThis script processes taxi trip data from two sources (green and yellow taxis) using PySpark, a Python library for Apache Spark. It reads Parquet files containing trip data, standardizes the column names, combines the data, and performs aggregations to compute monthly revenue and other statistics. Finally, it saves the processed results into a BigQuery table.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **argparse**: This module provides a command-line argument parser.\n- **pyspark**: Used for handling big data processing with Apache Spark.\n- **SparkSession**: The entry point for reading data and creating DataFrame work.\n- **functions as F**: This is used to leverage Spark SQL functions conveniently.\n\n## Command-Line Arguments\n\nThe script requires three command-line arguments:\n- `--input_green`: Path to the input Parquet file for green taxi data.\n- `--input_yellow`: Path to the input Parquet file for yellow taxi data.\n- `--output`: Path to the output BigQuery table location for storing results.\n\n## Initializing Spark Session\n\nThe script initializes a Spark session named 'test'. A temporary bucket for GCP Dataproc is also set to handle intermediate files during execution. This ensures that Spark processes the data efficiently.\n\n```python\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName('test') \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\nspark.conf.set('temporaryGcsBucket', 'dataproc-temp-europe-west6-...')\n```\n\n## Reading and Preparing DataFrames\n\nGreen and yellow taxi data are read from Parquet files into separate DataFrames (`df_green` and `df_yellow`). The relevant datetime columns are renamed to provide a uniform schema.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet(input_green) \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n\ndf_yellow = spark.read.parquet(input_yellow) \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_d",

Using the command shell via the exclamation mark (`!`) allows executing shell commands within a Jupyter notebook.\n\n## Inspecting the Downloaded File\n\n```python\n!head taxi+_zone_lookup.csv\n```\n\nThe `head` command is executed to preview the contents of the downloaded CSV file. This command displays the first few lines of the file, providing an overview of the data structure and the information it contains.\n\n## Reading the CSV into a DataFrame\n\n```python\ndf = spark.read \\\n    .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\\n    .csv('taxi+_zone_lookup.csv')\n```\n\nIn this block, the CSV file is read into a Spark DataFrame. The `option(\"header\", \"true\")` specifies that the first row of the CSV file contains column headers, enabling Spark to correctly interpret the data structure. The resulting DataFrame `df` will hold the taxi zone data for subsequent analysis.\n\n## Displaying the DataFrame\n\n```python\ndf.show()\n```\n\nThe `show()` method is called on the DataFrame `df`, which displays the contents of the DataFrame. By default, it shows the first 20 rows, making it easy to visualize the data and verify that it was loaded correctly.\n\n## Writing the DataFrame to Parquet Format\n\n```python\ndf.write.parquet('",
