What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)?\n   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), used for provisioning infrastructure resources\n   * supports DevOps best practices for change management\n   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state \n     for testing and production environments\n2. What is IaC?\n   * Infrastructure-as-Code\n   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way \n     by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.\n3. Some advantages\n   * Infrastructure lifecycle management\n   * Version control commits\n   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8S\u2026\n   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments\n\n\n#### Files\n\n* `main.tf`\n* `variables.tf`\n* Optional: `resources.tf`, `output.tf`\n* `.tfstate`\n\n#### Declarations\n* `terraform`: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure\n   * `required_version`: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration\n   * `backend`: stores Terraform's \"state\" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration.\n      * `local`: stores state file locally as `terraform.tfstate`\n   * `required_providers`: specifies the providers required by the current module\n* `provider`:\n   * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage\n   * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.\n* `resource`\n  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure\n  * Project modules/resources: google_storage_bucket, google_bigquery_dataset, google_bigquery_table\n* `variable` & `locals`\n  * runtime arguments and constants\n\n\n#### Execution ste",

Create an account with your Google email ID \n2. Setup your first [project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) if you haven't already\n    * eg. \"DTC DE Course\", and note down the \"Project ID\" (we'll use this later when deploying infra with TF)\n3. Setup [service account & authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for this project\n    * Grant `Viewer` role to begin with.\n    * Download service-account-keys (.json) for auth.\n4. Download [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) for local setup\n5. Set environment variable to point to your downloaded GCP keys:\n   ```shell\n   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json\"\n   \n   # Refresh token/session, and verify authentication\n   gcloud auth application-default login\n   ```\n   \n### Setup for Access\n \n1. [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) for Service account:\n   * Go to the *IAM* section of *IAM & Admin* https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam\n   * Click the *Edit principal* icon for your service account.\n   * Add these roles in addition to *Viewer* : **Storage Admin** + **Storage Object Admin** + **BigQuery Admin**\n   \n2. Enable these APIs for your project:\n   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com\n   * https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com\n   \n3. Please ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` env-var is set.\n   ```shell\n   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json\"\n   ```\n \n### Terraform Workshop to create GCP Infra\nConti",

Here\u2019s a summary of some key modules:\n\n1. **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**:\n   - **Usage**: Acts as a Data Lake.\n   - **Purpose**: Provides scalable and durable storage for structured and unstructured data.\n\n2. **BigQuery**:\n   - **Usage**: Serves as a Data Warehouse.\n   - **Purpose**: Allows for powerful querying and analysis of large datasets, providing capabilities to execute SQL queries interactively or as part of data processing pipelines.\n\n### Additional Information on Infrastructure Management:\n- You can use **Terraform** to manage these GCP services as code, enabling infrastructure as code (IaC) practices that make provisioning and managing cloud resources easier. Common Terraform resources for GCP include:\n   - `google_storage_bucket` for GCS.\n   - `google_bigquery_dataset` for managing datasets in BigQuery.\n   - `google_bigquery_table` for defining tables within those datasets.\n\nFor hands-on exercises and in-depth application, refer to specific Terraform documentation [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/2_gcp_overview.md).\n\nBy using these modules effectively, you can set up a robust infrastructure while leveraging GCP\u2019s capabilities for data storage and analysis.\n\nFor more details, please check the course materials from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-docker-terraform/1_terraform_gcp/2_gcp_overview.md).",
