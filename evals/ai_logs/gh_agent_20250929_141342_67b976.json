By processing the raw data from a source table, it aggregates, filters, and formats the information relevant to taxi trips, generating a view that can be reused for reporting and analysis.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe model is set to materialize as a view, which means that the resulting dataset will be generated and stored but not actually duplicated in the database. This materialization provides a dynamic result when queried, always reflecting the latest data available in the source.\n\n```sql\n{{ config(materialized='view') }}\n```\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nThe initial data preparation is encapsulated within a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `tripdata`. This CTE uses a `ROW_NUMBER()` window function to assign a sequential number to each row of trip data based on the `vendorid` and `tpep_pickup_datetime`. This is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent selection operates on unique trips and avoids redundant entries.\n\n```sql\nwith tripdata as \n(\n  select *,\n    row_number() over(partition by vendorid, tpep_pickup_datetime) as rn\n  from {{ source('staging','yellow_tripdata') }}\n  where vendorid is not null \n)\n```\n\nThis preparation also includes filtering out any records where `vendorid` is null, which ensures that only valid vendor entries are retained.\n\n## Selecting Trip Data\n\nThe main selection pulls various fields from the `tripdata` CTE, including identifiers, timestamps, trip information, and payment-related data. It uses utility functions provided by dbt to ensure proper data types and transformations.\n\n```sql\nselect\n   {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['vendorid', 'tpep_pickup_datetime']) }} as tripid,    \n   {{ dbt.safe_cast(\"vendorid\", api.Column.translate_type(\"integer\")) }} as vendorid,\n   ...\nfrom tripdata\nwhere rn = 1\n```\n\n### Identifiers\n\n1. **Trip ID**: A surrogate key is generated combining `vendorid` and `t",

              "content": "# Overview\n\nThis SQL script is part of a data transformation process using dbt (data build tool), which focuses on preparing taxi trip data for analysis. The goal of the script is to create a view containing structured and cleaned trip data by transforming the raw data from the staging area. The script achieves this through various SQL functions and casting techniques.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe script begins with a configuration block that specifies the materialization of the resulting data model. Here, the materialization is set to `'view'`, indicating that the output will be a view in the database. Views allow for simpler querying and can represent dynamic data sources.\n\n```sql\n{{\n    config(\n        materialized='view'\n    )\n}}\n```\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nNext, a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `tripdata` is created. This CTE selects all columns from a source table (`green_tripdata`) located in the `staging` schema. It adds a computed column (`rn`), which uses the `row_number()` function to assign a unique row number to each record, partitioning the data by `vendorid` and `lpep_pickup_datetime`. This step essentially allows the script to handle potential duplicate records efficiently.\n\n```sql\nwith tripdata as \n(\n  select *,\n    row_number() over(partition by vendorid, lpep_pickup_datetime) as rn\n  from {{ source('staging','green_tripdata') }}\n  where vendorid is not null \n)\n```\n\n## Selection of Key Fields\n\nFollowing the preparation of the `tripdata` CTE, the script selects various fields from it. The objective is to create a structured output that retains only necessary pieces of information relevant for analysis. \n\n### Identifiers\n\nThe query generates a surrogate key `tripid` by using the `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key` function, which helps in uniquely identifying each trip. Additional identifiers such as `vendorid`, `ratecodeid`, `pulocationid`, and `dolocationid` are safely cast to integers.\n\n```sql\nselect\n    {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['vendorid'",

Here\u2019s an example:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW avg_trip_time_between_zones AS\n   WITH trip_times AS (\n       SELECT \n           tr.pulocationid AS pickup_zone,\n           tr.dolocationid AS dropoff_zone,\n           EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (tr.tpep_dropoff_datetime - tr.tpep_pickup_datetime)) / 60 AS trip_duration -- Convert to minutes\n       FROM trip_data tr\n       WHERE tr.tpep_pickup_datetime IS NOT NULL AND tr.tpep_dropoff_datetime IS NOT NULL\n   )\n   SELECT \n       tz1.zone AS pickup_zone,\n       tz2.zone AS dropoff_zone,\n       AVG(tt.trip_duration) AS average_trip_time,\n       MIN(tt.trip_duration) AS min_trip_time,\n       MAX(tt.trip_duration) AS max_trip_time\n   FROM trip_times tt\n   JOIN taxi_zones tz1 ON tt.pickup_zone = tz1.location_id\n   JOIN taxi_zones tz2 ON tt.dropoff_zone = tz2.location_id\n   GROUP BY tz1.zone, tz2.zone;\n   ```\n\n   In this query:\n   - `trip_data` is the table containing all taxi trip records.\n   - `taxi_zones` is the table that links location IDs with human-readable zone names.\n   - The `WITH` clause computes the time taken for each trip in minutes.\n   - The final `SELECT` statement aggregates this data to find average, minimum, and maximum trip durations grouped by their taxi zones.\n\n3. **Execute the SQL Query**: Run the SQL command in your database management system where the taxi data is stored.\n\n4. **Verify the View**: Once the materialized view is created, verify it by querying the view to ensure it returns the expected results.\n\n### Example of Querying the Materialized View\nAfter the materialized view is created, you can use a query like the following to find the pair of taxi zones with the highest average trip time:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    pickup_zone, \n    dropoff_zone, \n    average_trip_time\nFROM avg_trip_time_between_zones\nORDER BY average_trip_time DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis query fetches the pair of taxi zones with the maximum average trip duration.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Materialized views are beneficial because they store the result of the query physically, which can improve performance for complex queries.\n- It's essential to update or refresh the materialized view regularly to ensure it reflects any changes in the underlying data.\n\nFor further reference on this topic, you can check the material from the course [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/workshops/rising-wave.md).",
