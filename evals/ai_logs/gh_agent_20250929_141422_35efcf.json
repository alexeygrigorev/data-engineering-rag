The script includes operations for creating external tables, counting records, and creating new tables based on the external data.\n\n## Table Creation\n\n### External Table Definition\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`\nOPTIONS (\n  format = 'CSV',\n  uris = ['gs://nyc-tl-data/trip data/fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv']\n);\n```\n\nThis part of the script creates or replaces an external table named `fhv_tripdata` in the `taxi-rides-ny` project, specifically under the `nytaxi` dataset. The external table is defined to read CSV files stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. The `uris` option points to all CSV files matching the pattern `fhv_tripdata_2019-*.csv`, which includes all FHV trip data files for 2019. By using an external table, the content in the files can be queried directly without needing to load it into a regular database table.\n\n## Data Overview and Count\n\n### Total Records Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nThis query counts the total number of records present in the `fhv_tripdata` external table. This count can provide insights into the overall amount of trip data collected for the designated period.\n\n### Unique Dispatch Base Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(dispatching_base_num)) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_tripdata`;\n```\n\nHere, the script counts the number of distinct dispatching base numbers found in the `fhv_tripdata`. The dispatching base number is likely a unique identifier for the different taxi service providers. This query helps in understanding how many unique operators are present in the dataset.\n\n## Data Transformation\n\n### Non-Partitioned Table Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_nonpartitioned_tripdata`\nAS",
              "code": false,

Data Selection\n\n```sql\nSELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, PULocationID, DOLocationID, payment_type, fare_amount, tolls_amount, tip_amount\nFROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned` WHERE fare_amount != 0;\n```\n\nThe initial step involves querying a dataset containing information on taxi rides. The script selects specific columns that include passenger count, trip distance, pickup and drop-off location IDs, payment type, fare amounts, tolls, and tip amounts. Importantly, it filters out rows where the fare amount is zero, indicating that only valid trips are considered for further analysis.\n\n## 2. Creation of ML Table\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_ml` (\n`passenger_count` INTEGER,\n`trip_distance` FLOAT64,\n`PULocationID` STRING,\n`DOLocationID` STRING,\n`payment_type` STRING,\n`fare_amount` FLOAT64,\n`tolls_amount` FLOAT64,\n`tip_amount` FLOAT64\n) AS (\nSELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, cast(PULocationID AS STRING), CAST(DOLocationID AS STRING),\nCAST(payment_type AS STRING), fare_amount, tolls_amount, tip_amount\nFROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned` WHERE fare_amount != 0\n);\n```\n\nNext, a new table named `yellow_tripdata_ml` is created to store a Machine Learning (ML) relevant dataset. It includes the same selected columns and specifies appropriate data types for each column. The use of `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` indicates that if this table already exists, it will be replaced with the new data, ensuring that it always contains the most current data.\n\n## 3. Model Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.tip_model`\nOPTIONS\n(model_type='linear_reg',\ninput_label_cols=['tip_amount'],\nDATA_SPLIT_METHOD='AUTO_SPLIT') AS\nSELECT\n*\nFROM\n`taxi-rides-ny.nyt",

The SQL commands used are functionally the same, just referencing the `yellow` table.\n\n## Writing Yellow Taxi Revenue Data to Disk\n\nAfter gathering the yellow taxi revenue data, we write it to disk.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow_revenue \\\n    .repartition(20) \\\n    .write.parquet('data/report/revenue/yellow', mode='overwrite')\n```\n\nSimilar to the green taxi data, the revenue for yellow taxis is stored in the specified directory with a repa",

Each month, the corresponding CSV data is read, processed, and stored efficiently in the Parquet format.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis script effectively processes both green and yellow taxi datasets, transforming raw CSV files into Parquet files. This transition not only optimizes storage but also enhances performance for subsequent data analysis.

The dataset is then read using the defined green schema, and the data is unevenly repartitioned into four partitions before being written in Parquet format to the defined output path.\n\n## Processing Yellow Taxi Data\n\nFollowing the same method, the yellow taxi data is processed for the years 2020 and 2021.\n\n```python\nyear = 2020\n\nfor month in range(1, 13):\n    print(f'processing data for {year}/{month}')\n\n    input_path = f'data/raw/yellow/{year}/{month:02d}/'\n    output_path = f'data/pq/yellow/{year}/{month:02d}/'\n\n    df_yellow = spark.read \\\n        .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\\n        .schema(yellow_schema) \\\n        .csv(input_path)\n\n    df_yellow \\\n        .repartition(4) \\\n        .write.parquet(output_path)\n```\n\nThis block packages the same logic but for yellow taxis in the year 2020. Here, the data is read utilizing the yellow schema and is written in Parquet format with similar output configurations.\n\n```python\nyear = 2021\n\nfor month in range(1, 13):\n    print(f'processing data for {year}/{month}')\n\n    input_path = f'data/raw/yellow/{year}/{month:02d}/'\n    output_path = f'data/pq/yellow/{year}/{month:02d}/'\n\n    df_yellow = spark.read \\\n        .option(\"header\", \"true\") \\\n        .schema(yellow_schema) \\\n        .csv(input_path)\n\n    df_yellow \\\n        .repartition(4) \\\n        .write.parquet(output_path)\n```\n\nIn this chunk, the same procedure is repeated for the yellow taxi data from the year 2021. Each month, the corresponding CSV data is read, processed, and stored efficiently in the Parquet format.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis script effectively processes both green and yellow taxi datasets, transforming raw CSV file",

The `.read.parquet()` method allows us to easily read the Parquet files stored in the designated folder.\n\n```python\ndf_green = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/green/*/*')\n```\n\nThis line imports all green taxi data into a DataFrame called `df_green`. Parquet format is efficient for reading and processing large datasets, making it ideal for our analysis.\n\n## Renaming Columns in Green Taxi Data\n\nAfter loading the data, it's important to standardize column names for better consistency and usability. The following code renames the relevant columns in the green taxi DataFrame.\n\n```python\ndf_green = df_green \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('lpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n```\n\nHere, we standardize the naming of the pickup and dropoff datetime columns to `pickup_datetime` and `dropoff_datetime` for uniformity across datasets.\n\n## Loading Data for Yellow Taxis\n\nSimilar to the green taxis, we will also load the yellow taxi data using the same methodology to maintain consistency in our dataset shapes.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow = spark.read.parquet('data/pq/yellow/*/*')\n```\n\nThis line reads all yellow taxi data from the specified Parquet files into a DataFrame called `df_yellow`.\n\n## Renaming Columns in Yellow Taxi Data\n\nAs with the green taxi data, we need to rename the columns in the yellow taxi DataFrame to ensure consistency.\n\n```python\ndf_yellow = df_yellow \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_pickup_datetime', 'pickup_datetime') \\\n    .withColumnRenamed('tpep_dropoff_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime')\n```\n\nWe rename the datetime columns in the yellow taxi DataFrame to match the green taxi DataFrame, utilizing the same standardized naming convention.\n\n## Identifying Common Columns\n\nBefore combining the two datasets, we should identify the common columns they share. This process helps us ensure that the merged DataFrame will contain consistent columns.\n\n```python\ncommon_colums = []\n\nye",

          "content": "Repartitioning is a crucial process when working with large datasets, particularly in data engineering contexts such as processing NYC taxi datasets. It involves redistributing the data across a specified number of partitions in order to optimize performance during data operations. Here's an overview based on the course materials:\n\n### How Repartitioning Works:\n- **Redistributing Data:** Repartitioning changes the number of partitions in a dataset, which can help distribute the dataset more evenly across available resources (such as executors in a Spark cluster). This is particularly important when dealing with operations that require significant data processing or aggregation.\n- **Example Usage:** In the provided scripts, you will see calls such as `df_green.repartition(20)` and `df_yellow.repartition(4)` just before writing the DataFrame to disk in Parquet format. This indicates that the data is reorganized into 20 or 4 partitions, respectively, to enhance parallel processing capabilities when the data is written or read.\n\n### Importance for Processing Taxi Datasets:\n- **Optimized Parallelism:** Repartitioning allows Spark (or another data processing engine) to parallelize operations effectively. For instance, when writing large datasets, repartitioning ensures that the write operation is distributed across multiple tasks rather than overloading a single one.\n- **Balanced Processing Load:** Especially with datasets that might grow over time (like taxi trip data), having a balanced number of partitions means each processing task will handle a roughly equal amount of data. This helps avoid performance bottlenecks.\n- **Facilitating Query Performance:** Efficiently partitioning a large dataset can improve query performance because operations can be performed on smaller, manageable chunks of data rather than loading the entire dataset into memory for processing.\n\nIn the context of the taxi dataset scripts, proper repartitioning ensures that both the green and yellow taxi data can be processed quickly and efficiently, ultimately leading to faster query responses and reduced resource consumption when these datasets are later analyzed or utilized for machine learning tasks.\n\nFor specific code examples, you can refer to the following segments of the notebooks:\n- [Processing Green Taxi Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/code/07_groupby_join.ipynb)\n- [Processing Yellow Taxi Data](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/code/06_spark_sql.ipynb)\n\nBy including repartitioning operations in your data processing workflow, you are effectively preparing the data for better performance in subsequent analyses.",
