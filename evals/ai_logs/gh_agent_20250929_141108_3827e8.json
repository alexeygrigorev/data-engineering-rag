The workflow is scheduled to run at 6 AM on the 2nd day of every month, starting from January 1, 2021.\n\n## Environment Variables\nThe code retrieves several environment variables required for database connectivity:\n- `PG_HOST`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL database server.\n- `PG_USER`: The username for database access.\n- `PG_PASSWORD`: The password for the specified user.\n- `PG_PORT`: The port on which the PostgreSQL server is running.\n- `PG_DATABASE`: The name of the database where data will be ingested.\n\nThe `AIRFLOW_HOME` variable is also set, which points to the base directory where Airflow stores its files and logs. If the `AIRFLOW_HOME` environment variable is not set, it defaults to `/opt/airflow/`.\n\n## DAG Definition\nThe DAG is instantiated using the `DAG` class from Airflow, with the following parameters:\n- **DAG ID**: \"LocalIngestionDag\"\n- **Schedule Interval**: \"0 6 2 * *\" (At 06:00 AM on the 2nd of every month)\n- **Start Date**: January 1, 2021\n\nThe `local_workflow` serves as the container for the defined tasks and manages the execution flow.\n\n## URLs and File Management\nThe script constructs several dynamic paths based on the execution date:\n- **URL_PREFIX**: Base URL for fetching the CSV files from AWS S3.\n- **URL_TEMPLATE**: A formatted string that generates the URL for the desired monthly CSV file.\n- **OUTPUT_FILE_TEMPLATE**: Template for the path where the downloaded file will be saved locally.\n- **TABLE_NAME_TEMPLATE**: Format for naming the database table to which the data will be ingested.\n\nThese templates utilize Jinja templating, allowing for dynamic file and table naming based on the execution date.\n\n## Tasks within the DAG\nThe DAG ",

The DAG includes tasks for downloading the dataset from a remote URL and uploading it to a specified GCS bucket.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe DAG is designed to run daily (`@daily`), ensuring that it fetches the most up-to-date dataset each day. It orchestrates two main tasks:\n\n1. **Downloading the Dataset**: Retrieves a CSV file containing trip data.\n2. **Uploading to Google Cloud Storage**: Transfers the downloaded file to a specified GCS bucket.\n\nThe workflow is structured to ensure that the upload task only begins after the download task completes successfully. This is indicated by the task dependency defined at the end of the DAG.\n\n## Environment Configuration\n\nThe script starts by importing necessary modules, including:\n\n- `os`: For accessing environment variables.\n- `datetime`: To handle date-related operations.\n- `airflow`: The core libraries for creating and managing the DAG.\n- `google.cloud.storage`: For interacting with Google Cloud Storage.\n\nSeveral environment variables are retrieved, allowing for configuration flexibility without hardcoding values. These include:\n\n- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: The Google Cloud project ID (default value set).\n- `GCP_GCS_BUCKET`: The name of the GCS bucket for uploading the data.\n- `AIRFLOW_HOME`: The directory for Airflow home settings.\n\nA URL for the dataset and a local file path for downloads are constructed using these environment variables.\n\n## DAG Definition\n\nA `DAG` instance is created with specific configurations:\n\n- **dag_id**: Unique identifier for the DAG (`data_ingestion_gcs_dag`).\n- **schedule_interval**: Set to run daily.\n- **default_args**: Includes common parameters like the owner, start date, and retry settings.\n- **catchup**: Allows the DAG to run for past d",

Key elements include:\n- `\"owner\"`: Identifies the owner of the DAG as \"airflow\".\n- `\"depends_on_past\"`: Set to `False`, which means tasks do not depend on the success of past runs.\n- `\"retries\"`: Configured to retry a task once in case of failure.\n\n## DAG Creation Function: `donwload_parquetize_upload_dag`\n\nThis function is responsible for defining the workflow of tasks for each DAG. It takes five parameters, including the DAG object and templates for URLs, local paths, and GCS paths.\n\nInside the function:\n1. A task is defined to download the CSV file using `BashOperator` with a `curl` command.\n2. The CSV file is then converted to Parquet format with the `format_to_parquet` function via a `PythonOperator`.\n3. The converted file is uploaded to GCS using another `PythonOperator`.\n4. Finally, a task is set to remove both the local CSV and Parquet files after the upload is complete.\n\nThe tasks are scheduled in sequence, ensuring that each step only executes after the previous one is done.\n\n## DAG Instances\n\nThe script instantiates four DAGs, each targeting different datasets:\n\n### Yellow Taxi Data DAG\n\n- **DAG ID**: `yellow_taxi_data_v2`\n- **Schedule**: Executes on the 2nd of each month at 6:00 AM.\n- **File Template Definitions**: Includes URL templates for the Yellow Taxi dataset and corresponding local and GCS paths.\n\n### Green Taxi Data DAG\n\n- **DAG ID**: `green_taxi_data_v1`\n- **Schedule**: Executes on the 2nd of each month at 7:00 AM.\n- **File Template Definitions**: Similar to the Yellow Taxi DAG, but for the Green Taxi dataset.\n\n### FHV Taxi Data DAG\n\n- **DAG ID**: `hfv_taxi_data_v1`\n- **Schedule**: Executes on the 2nd of each month at 8:00 AM.\n- **End Date**: The execution is limited to a maximum date of January 1, 2020.\n- **File Template Definitions**: Handles data specifically for FHV trips.\n\n### Zones Data DAG\n\n- **DAG ID**: `zones_data_v1`\n- **Sch",

          "content": "In an Apache Airflow DAG, environment variables play a crucial role in establishing database connectivity and defining operational parameters without hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code. Here\u2019s how it generally works based on the documentation extracted from course materials:\n\n1. **Environment Variable Retrieval**: Typically, the DAG script accesses various environment variables that contain connection details. For example:\n   - **PostgreSQL Database**:\n     - `PG_HOST`: Hostname of the PostgreSQL server.\n     - `PG_USER`: Username for database access.\n     - `PG_PASSWORD`: Password for the specified user.\n     - `PG_PORT`: Port number on which the PostgreSQL server is running.\n     - `PG_DATABASE`: Name of the database where data will be ingested.\n\n   - **Google Cloud Storage**:\n     - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`: Google Cloud project ID.\n     - `GCP_GCS_BUCKET`: Name of the GCS bucket used for storing data.\n\n   These variables make it easier to manage configurations across different environments (development, testing, production) without changing the source code.\n\n2. **Configuration Flexibility**: The retrieved environment variables allow for greater flexibility. For example, if the environment changes (like a new database or bucket), only the environment variables need to be updated rather than altering the entire script.\n\n3. **Usage in Task Definitions**: Within the DAG, these environment variables are used to configure operators that manage the actual database connections or data uploads/downloads. For instance, a task may utilize these variables when defining a connection to a PostgreSQL database or when using Google Cloud services.\n\n4. **Setting Defaults**: In some implementations, default values may be established in case the environment variables are not set. This ensures that the DAG can still function in a controlled manner even if certain configurations are missed.\n\n### Example from Course Material\nIn the **LocalIngestionDag**, the script retrieves connection-related environment variables for PostgreSQL:\n\n```python\nPG_HOST = os.getenv('PG_HOST')\nPG_USER = os.getenv('PG_USER')\nPG_PASSWORD = os.getenv('PG_PASSWORD')\nPG_PORT = os.getenv('PG_PORT')\nPG_DATABASE = os.getenv('PG_DATABASE')\n```\n\nThis setup is essential for the DAG's tasks that interact with the database for downloading and ingesting data, facilitating a clear separation between configuration and logic.\n\nFor further details and examples, you can view the source code [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2022/week_2_data_ingestion/airflow/dags_local/data_ingestion_local.py).",
