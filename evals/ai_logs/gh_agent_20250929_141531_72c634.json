Change into the project's directory from the command line: `$ cd [..]/taxi_rides_ny`\n2. Load the CSVs into the database. This materializes the CSVs as tables in your target schema: `$ dbt seed`\n3. Run the models: `$ dbt run`\n4. Test your data: `$ dbt test`\n_Alternative: use `$ dbt build` to execute with one command the 3 steps above together_\n5. Generate documentation for the project: `$ dbt docs generate`\n6. View the documentation for the project, this step should open the documentation page on a webserver, but it can also be accessed from  http://localhost:8080 : `$ dbt docs serve`\n\n### dbt resources:\n- Learn more about dbt [in the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)\n- Check out [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/) for commonly asked questions and answers\n- Join the [chat](http://slack.getdbt.com/) on Slack for live discussions and support\n- Find [dbt events](https://events.getdbt.com) near you\n- Check out [the blog](https://blog.getdbt.com/) for the latest news on dbt's development and best practices",

This approach increases the risk of exposing sensitive credentials when the code is shared or deployed. \n- **Best Practices**: It is recommended to utilize secure methods for managing and accessing these credentials, such as environment variables, configuration management tools, or secure vaults (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).\n\n### Integration\n\nDevelopers utilizing this class should replace the placeholder values with their actual credentials before deployment. The structure allows for easy integration with Kafka clients and schema management tools within the application that utilizes the `Secrets` class.\n\n### Consistency and Convention\n\nDefining the keys and secrets as `public static final` ensures they are constants that can be accessed without instantiating the class. This approach maintains consistency and clarity when referring to authentication credentials throughout the applicatio",
