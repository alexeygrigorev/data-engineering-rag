It encapsulates various attributes related to a taxi ride, such as the vendor ID, pickup and drop-off times, passenger count, trip distance, fare details, and more. This class can be used to create objects that represent individual rides, either from a list of attributes or from a dictionary.\n\n## Class Initialization\n\n### Constructor\n\nThe `__init__` method is the constructor for the `Ride` class. It takes a list of string attributes `arr` that contains all the necessary details for a ride. The attributes are parsed and assigned to instance variables, including:\n\n- **vendor_id**: A string indicative of the vendor providing the service.\n- **tpep_pickup_datetime**: The date and time when the ride was picked up, converted to a `datetime` object.\n- **tpep_dropoff_datetime**: The date and time of ride drop-off, also converted to a `datetime` object.\n- **passenger_count**: The number of passengers in the ride, converted to an integer.\n- **trip_distance**: The distance of the trip, represented as a `Decimal` for precision.\n- **rate_code_id**: An integer representing the rate code applied to the ride.\n- **store_and_fwd_flag**: A flag indicating whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n- **pu_location_id**: The pickup location ID, converted to an integer.\n- **do_location_id**: The drop-off location ID, converted to an integer.\n- **payment_type**: The method of payment used for the trip.\n- **fare_amount**: The base fare amount of the ride, represented as a `Decimal`.\n- **extra**: Any additional charges.\n- **mta_tax**: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax.\n- **tip_amount**: The tip amount provided by the rider.\n- **tolls_amount**: The amount charged for tolls during the trip.\n- **improvement_surcharge**: Charges related to improvements.\n- **total_amount**: The total amount charged for the ride.\n- **congestion_surcharge**: An additional charge related to congestion.",

Data Selection\n\n```sql\nSELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, PULocationID, DOLocationID, payment_type, fare_amount, tolls_amount, tip_amount\nFROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned` WHERE fare_amount != 0;\n```\n\nThe initial step involves querying a dataset containing information on taxi rides. The script selects specific columns that include passenger count, trip distance, pickup and drop-off location IDs, payment type, fare amounts, tolls, and tip amounts. Importantly, it filters out rows where the fare amount is zero, indicating that only valid trips are considered for further analysis.\n\n## 2. Creation of ML Table\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_ml` (\n`passenger_count` INTEGER,\n`trip_distance` FLOAT64,\n`PULocationID` STRING,\n`DOLocationID` STRING,\n`payment_type` STRING,\n`fare_amount` FLOAT64,\n`tolls_amount` FLOAT64,\n`tip_amount` FLOAT64\n) AS (\nSELECT passenger_count, trip_distance, cast(PULocationID AS STRING), CAST(DOLocationID AS STRING),\nCAST(payment_type AS STRING), fare_amount, tolls_amount, tip_amount\nFROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned` WHERE fare_amount != 0\n);\n```\n\nNext, a new table named `yellow_tripdata_ml` is created to store a Machine Learning (ML) relevant dataset. It includes the same selected columns and specifies appropriate data types for each column. The use of `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` indicates that if this table already exists, it will be replaced with the new data, ensuring that it always contains the most current data.\n\n## 3. Model Creation\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.tip_model`\nOPTIONS\n(model_type='linear_reg',\ninput_label_cols=['tip_amount'],\nDATA_SPLIT_METHOD='AUTO_SPLIT') AS\nSELECT\n*\nFROM\n`taxi-rides-ny.nyt",

The class is primarily structured to parse data from a list or a dictionary, encapsulating various attributes that pertain to a ride. The attributes include details such as vendor identification, pickup and dropoff times, passenger count, trip distance, and various fare components.\n\n## Class Definition\n### `Ride` Class\nThe `Ride` class includes multiple methods and attributes that enable the representation and manipulation of ride data.\n\n### Attributes\nThe attributes of the `Ride` class are initialized through the constructor (`__init__`) and include the following:\n\n- `vendor_id`: A string representing the ID of the vendor providing the ride.\n- `tpep_pickup_datetime`: A `datetime` object representing the time the ride was picked up, parsed from a string input.\n- `tpep_dropoff_datetime`: A `datetime` object representing the time the ride was dropped off, also parsed from a string input.\n- `passenger_count`: An integer indicating the number of passengers in the ride.\n- `trip_distance`: A `Decimal` representing the distance of the trip.\n- `rate_code_id`: An integer representing the rate code associated with the ride.\n- `store_and_fwd_flag`: A string indicating whether the ride data was stored and forwarded.\n- `pu_location_id`: An integer that represents the pickup location ID.\n- `do_location_id`: An integer that represents the dropoff location ID.\n- `payment_type`: A string indicating the method of payment for the ride.\n- `fare_amount`: A `Decimal` representing the fare charged for the ride.\n- `extra`: A `Decimal` indicating any additional charges.\n- `mta_tax`: A `Decimal` representing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority tax.\n- `tip_amount`: A `Decimal` indicating the tip given for the ride.\n- `tolls_amount`: A `Decimal` representing the total tolls incurred during the ride.\n- `improvement_surcharge`: A `Decimal` indicating any imp",

This count helps to evaluate the number of trips made by specific taxi companies during the first quarter of 2019.\n\n### Partitioned Data Count\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(*) FROM `taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.fhv_partitioned_tripdata`\nWHERE DATE(dropoff_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-01-01' AND '2019-03-31'\n  AND dispatching_base_num IN ('B00987', 'B02279', 'B02060');\n```\n\nThe final query performs a similar count, but this time against the `fhv_partitioned_tripdata`. The filtering criteria are the same as the previous query, allowing for direct comparison of performance and results between querying a partitioned and non-partitioned table. This will demonstrate how partitioning may affect query execution time and efficiency.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this script effectively sets up a workflow for managing and analyzing New York City's taxi ride data through various SQL operations. It:\n\n1. Creates an external representation of FHV trip data.\n2. Provides methods for counting total and unique entries.\n3. Transforms the external dataset into both non-partitioned and partitioned tables to enhance data management and query performance.\n4. Executes filtered queries to retrieve data for specified dispatch bases during the first quarter of 2019.\n\nBy structuring the data in partitioned formats, it aims ",

This representation enables easy inspection of the object's state, making it clearer when printed or logged.\n\n## Data Handling and Types\n\nThe class uses various data types, particularly:\n\n- **Datetime**: For storing date and time values.\n- **Decimal**: For monetary values and distances, ensuring precision during calculations.\n- **Integer and String**: For attributes that are inherently numeric or categorical.\n\nThis careful selection ensures that the data model can handle typical operations without introducing issues related to floating point precision or string handling.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nThis class can serve various applications related to taxi services or fleet management systems. By creating instances of `Ride`, developers can manipulate ride data, analyze patterns (like average fare or distance), or prepare reports for ride statistics. This encapsulated data model simplifies the processing of ride data and integrates easily into larger systems.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the `Ride` class is a well-defined structure for managing taxi ride information. It provides mechanisms to create an object from both lists and dictionaries, allowing for flexibility in data ingestion. The representation method enhances usability for debugging and provides a clear view of the object's attributes at any given moment.\n\nDevelopers can build upon this class further by adding methods for processing ride data or implementing custom business logic, such as fare calculations or distance validations, which can extend its functionality effectively.",
