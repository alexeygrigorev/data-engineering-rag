It leverages the KafkaProducer from the Kafka library to facilitate message queueing and delivery. The provided settings such as bootstrap servers and input data path are fetched from external configuration files.\n\n## Imports\nThe script begins by importing necessary modules and classes:\n- `csv`: For reading data from CSV files.\n- `json`: For serializing ride data into JSON format.\n- `List`, `Dict`: For type hinting, improving clarity of function signatures.\n- `KafkaProducer`, `KafkaTimeoutError`: For creating a producer instance to send messages to a Kafka topic and handling potential timeout exceptions.\n- `Ride`: A custom class that is presumed to encapsulate the details of a ride record.\n- `settings`: External settings importing for configuration constants.\n\n## Class: JsonProducer\nThe `JsonProducer` class extends `KafkaProducer` and encapsulates functionality specific to producing JSON serialized data to Kafka:\n\n### Constructor: `__init__`\n```python\ndef __init__(self, props: Dict):\n    self.producer = KafkaProducer(**props)\n```\n- Initializes the Kafka producer with provided properties defined in a dictionary, allowing for flexible and adjustable configurations.\n\n### Static Method: `read_records`\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n```\n- Accepts a file path as input and reads ride records from a CSV file.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Opens the specified CSV file for reading.\n  - Uses the `csv.reader` to parse the file, skipping the header.\n  - For each row, it creates an instance of `Ride` initialized with the row data and collects them into a list.\n  \n### Method: `publish_rides`\n```python\ndef publish_rides(self, topic: str, messages: List[Ride]):\n```\n- Responsible for sending ride messages to a specified Kafka topic.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - I",

Creates an instance of the `JsonProducer`.\n2. Calls the `getRides` method to read and parse the ride data.\n3. Passes the list of rides to the `publishRides` method to publish the data to the Kafka topic.\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, CsvException, ExecutionException, InterruptedException {\n    var producer = new JsonProducer();\n    var rides = producer.getRides();\n    producer.publishRides(rides);\n}\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe code incorporates basic error handling with exception propagation:\n- The methods `getRides` and `publishRides` throw `IOException` and `ExecutionException` or `InterruptedException`, allowing these exceptions to be handled at a higher level.\n- Additionally, errors encountered during the sending of records to Kafka are handled within the `publishRides` method using a callback.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe `JsonProducer` class effectively encapsulates the functionality to read ride data from a CSV file and publish it to a Kafka topic using a structured approach. By leveraging libraries like OpenCSV and Kafka, it implements a straightforward pipeline suitable for data streaming applications.",
