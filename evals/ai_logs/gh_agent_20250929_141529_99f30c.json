It uses a `StreamsBuilder` to define the flow of data processing:\n\n1. **Stream Definition**: It reads messages from the `rides` topic, using the custom serializer/deserializer for `Ride` objects.\n2. **Windowed Grouping and Counting**: The stream is grouped by their key and processed in time windows of 10 seconds, with a grace period of 5 seconds for late arriving data. The count of rides in each window is calculated.\n3. **Output Stream**: The result of the counting operation is sent to the `rides-pulocation-window-count` topic using a specified serializer for the window key and a long integer for the count.\n\n```java\npublic Topology createTopology() {\n    StreamsBuilder streamsBuilder = new StreamsBuilder();\n    var ridesStream = streamsBuilder.stream(\"rides\", Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), CustomSerdes.getSerde(Ride.class)));\n    var puLocationCount = ridesStream.groupByKey()\n            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeAndGrace(Duration.ofSeconds(10), Duration.ofSeconds(5)))\n            .count().toStream();\n    var windowSerde = WindowedSerdes.timeWindowedSerdeFrom(String.class, 10*1000);\n\n    puLocationCount.to(\"rides-pulocation-window-count\", Produced.with(windowSerde, Serdes.Long()));\n    return streamsBuilder.build();\n}\n```\n\n## Stream Processing\n### `countPLocationWindowed()`\nThis method initializes the Kafka Streams application:\n\n1. **Create Topology**: Invokes the `createTopology()` method to define the processing logic.\n2. **Start KafkaStreams Instance**: Creates a `KafkaStreams` object with the defined topology and properties, then calls `start()` to begin processing.\n3. **Shutdown Hook**: Registers a shutdown hook to cleanly close the Kafka Streams instance on application termination.\n\n```java\npublic void countPLo",

The `join` uses a `ValueJoiner` that checks if the difference between the drop-off and pickup times is within 10 minutes.\n   - If the condition is met, a new `VendorInfo` instance is created, containing the ride and location information.\n\n4. **Windowing**: The joining operation uses a time window of 20 minutes and a grace period of 5 minutes.\n\n5. **Filtering and Output**: After the join, the resulting stream is filtered to exclude any `Optional` values that are empty. The final results, containing `VendorInfo`, are sent to the `OUTPUT_TOPIC`.\n\n## Stream Execution\n\n### Kafka Streams Lifecycle Management\n\nThe `joinRidesPickupLocation` method executes and manages the Kafka Streams lifecycle:\n\n1. **Topology Building**: Calls the `createTopology` method to build the processing topology.\n2. **Stream Initialization**: Constructs a `KafkaStreams` instance with the defined topology and properties.\n3. **Exception Handling**: Sets an uncaught exception handler that will log any exceptions and shut down the application gra",

It creates an instance of `JsonKStreamWindow` and invokes the method to start processing the ride data stream.\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    var object = new JsonKStreamWindow();\n    object.countPLocationWindowed();\n}\n```\n\n## Summary\nThe `JsonKStreamWindow` class encapsulates the functionality of a Kafka Streams application dedicated to counting ride occurrences by pickup location. It effectively leverages windowing to manage time-based stream processing, ensuring that data aggregation is performed on sliding time windows. The application is designed to be robust, with safety measures for connection and shutdown, making it suitable for production-like environments where real-tim",

          "content": "The `createTopology()` method is a critical part of the data processing logic in a Kafka Streams application. This method is responsible for defining the data flow and processing logic applied to incoming streams of data. Here's a detailed breakdown of its significance:\n\n1. **Stream Definition**: The method begins by initializing a `StreamsBuilder`, which is an object that allows you to build out the topology of your stream processing application. It defines the source of the data, such as reading messages from the `rides` topic. This is done using a custom serializer/deserializer to transform the incoming data into a usable format (specifically into `Ride` objects).\n\n2. **Windowed Grouping and Counting**: One of the primary functions of this method is to define how incoming data should be grouped and processed. In this case, the stream of rides is grouped by their key (e.g., pickup locations). The application processes these groups of data in defined time windows (10 seconds in this instance), which allows for counting the number of rides during that time frame. A grace period of 5 seconds is also defined to accommodate late arrivals of data.\n\n3. **Output Stream**: After processing (counting the rides within specified windows), the results are sent to another topic (`rides-pulocation-window-count`). This step involves defining how the data will be serialized for output, specifically ensuring that the windowing information and the count are formatted correctly for consumption by downstream systems.\n\n4. **Return Topology**: Finally, the method returns the constructed topology, which encapsulates all the defined processing logic. This topology is then used to instantiate the Kafka Streams application, which begins the data processing cycle.\n\nOverall, `createTopology()` is essential as it formalizes the logic of how data should flow through the application, including how it's ingested, processed, and output. It leverages Kafka Streams' powerful capabilities to enable real-time processing of streaming data.\n\nThis information can be referenced in detail from the course material located here: [Kafka Streams Topology Creation](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonKStreamWindow.java).",
