It makes use of pandas for data manipulation, requests for HTTP operations, and the Google Cloud Storage client for uploading files.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore executing this script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n1. Install necessary Python packages:\n   ```\n   pip install pandas pyarrow google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n2. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to your project/service account key.\n\n3. Define the `GCP_GCS_BUCKET` environment variable to specify your GCS bucket. If not set, it will default to \"dtc-data-lake-bucketname\".\n\n## Constants and URL Setup\n\nThe script initializes a constant URL pointing to the GitHub repository where the NYC TLC data is hosted:\n```python\ninit_url = 'https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/'\n```\nAdditionally, it retrieves the name of the GCS bucket from the environment variable:\n```python\nBUCKET = os.environ.get(\"GCP_GCS_BUCKET\", \"dtc-data-lake-bucketname\")\n```\n\n## Function: upload_to_gcs\n\nThis function is responsible for uploading files to Google Cloud Storage.

Within this function:\n\n- A DDL (Data Definition Language) SQL string is dynamically constructed using the table name `taxi_events`.\n- Various columns are defined along with their data types, including `VendorID`, `lpep_pickup_datetime`, `passenger_count`, and financial fields like `fare_amount` and `tip_amount`.\n- The function configures the JDBC connection parameters for PostgreSQL (URL, username, password, and JDBC driver).\n- The SQL DDL statement is executed using the provided `TableEnvironment`, and the function returns the name of the created table.\n\n## Function: `create_events_source_kafka`\n\nThe purpose of the `create_events_source_kafka` function is to establish a source table that reads from a Kafka topic. This is similarly done using a DDL SQL string. Key highlights include:\n\n- The function specifies a table name `taxi_events`, which matches the sink table created earlier.\n- Columns analogous to those in the sink table are defined, along with an additional `pickup_timestamp` column created from the `lpep_pickup_datetime`, enabling timestamp processing.\n- A watermark is defined to manage event time processing, allowing the system to handle late events up to 15 seconds.\n- Kafka connection settings are provided, including the bootstrap servers, topic name (`green-data`), and message format (JSON).\n- As with the previous function, this function also executes the DDL and returns the table name.\n\n## Function: `log_processing`\n\nThe `log_processing` function orchestrates the execution flow of the Flink application. The steps taken within this function are as follows:\n\n1. **Initialize Execution Environment**: The function creates a `StreamExecutionEnvironment` object and enables checkpointing every 10 seconds to ensure fault tolerance during streaming.\n   \n2. **Create Table Environment**: It sets up the streamin",

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of how the function works, including the data transformation steps:\n\n### Function Overview\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `year`: The year of the data (e.g., '2019', '2020').\n  - `service`: The type of taxi service (e.g., 'green', 'yellow').\n\n### Step-by-Step Data Transformation\n\n1. **Monthly Loop**:\n   The function iterates over each month from January (01) to December (12). For each iteration, it performs the following steps.\n\n2. **File Naming**:\n   It constructs the file name based on the `service` type and `year`, formatted to ensure the month has two digits (e.g., '01' for January).\n\n3. **HTTP Request**:\n   The function downloads the corresponding CSV file from a constructed URL using the `requests` library. The content of the downloaded CSV file is saved as a local file.\n\n4. **Data Reading and Conversion**:\n   - The CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame with gzip compression.\n   - The DataFrame is then transformed into a Parquet format, which is more efficient in terms of storage and query performance compared to CSV.\n\n5. **GCS Upload**:\n   After the conversion, the Parquet file is uploaded to the specified GCS bucket using an `upload_to_gcs` helper function.\n\n6. **Logging**:\n   Throughout the process, the function logs messages to provide feedback, such as indicating the creation of the local file and confirming successful uploads to GCS.\n\n### Example Execution\nAt the end of the script, you will find calls to the `web_to_gcs` function for specific years and taxi services, such as:\n```python\nweb_to_gcs('2019', 'green')\nweb_to_gcs('2020', 'green')\n```\nThese lines set the function up to process green taxi data for the years 2019 and 2020.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe `web_to_gcs` function is a systematic utility designed for downloading, transforming, and uploading NYC taxi trip data to GCS, ensuring that the data is in a more efficient format for later use.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the script in the course materials: [web_to_gcs.py](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-data-warehouse/extras/web_to_gcs.py).",
