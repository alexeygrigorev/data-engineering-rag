              "content": "# Documentation for LocalIngestionDag\n\n## Overview\nThis script defines an Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) named `LocalIngestionDag`, which is designed to automate the process of downloading CSV files from a specified URL (related to NYC taxi trip data) and ingesting the data into a PostgreSQL database. The workflow is scheduled to run at 6 AM on the 2nd day of every month, starting from January 1, 2021.\n\n## Environment Variables\nThe code retrieves several environment variables required for database connectivity:\n- `PG_HOST`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL database server.\n- `PG_USER`: The username for database access.\n- `PG_PASSWORD`: The password for the specified user.\n- `PG_PORT`: The port on which the PostgreSQL server is running.\n- `PG_DATABASE`: The name of the database where data will be ingested.\n\nThe `AIRFLOW_HOME` variable is also set, which points to the base directory where Airflow stores its files and logs. If the `AIRFLOW_HOME` environment variable is not set, it defaults to `/opt/airflow/`.\n\n## DAG Definition\nThe DAG is instantiated using the `DAG` class from Airflow, with the following parameters:\n- **DAG ID**: \"LocalIngestionDag\"\n- **Schedule Interval**: \"0 6 2 * *\" (At 06:00 AM on the 2nd of every month)\n- **Start Date**: January 1, 2021\n\nThe `local_workflow` serves as the container for the defined tasks and manages the execution flow.\n\n## URLs and File Management\nThe script constructs several dynamic paths based on the execution date:\n- **URL_PREFIX**: Base URL for fetching the CSV files from AWS S3.\n- **URL_TEMPLATE**: A formatted string that generates the URL for the desired monthly CSV file.\n- **OUTPUT_FILE_TEMPLATE**: Template for the path where the downloaded file will be saved locally.\n- **TABLE_NAME_TEMPLATE**: Format for naming the database table to which the data will be ingested.\n\nThese templates utilize Jinja templating, allowing for dynamic file and table naming based on the execution date.\n\n## Tasks within the DAG\nThe DAG ",

This function is expected to handle the logic for ingesting the CSV data into the specified PostgreSQL table.\n\n```python\ningest_task = PythonOperator(\n    task_id=\"ingest\",\n    python_callable=ingest_callable,\n    op_kwargs=dict(\n        user=PG_USER,\n        password=PG_PASSWORD,\n        host=PG_HOST,\n        port=PG_PORT,\n        db=PG_DATABASE,\n        table_name=TABLE_NAME_TEMPLATE,\n        csv_file=OUTPUT_FILE_TEMPLATE\n    ),\n)\n```\n\n## Task Dependencies\nThe two tasks are linked using the bitwise operator (`>>`), ensuring that the `ingest_task` runs only after the successful completion of the `wget_task`. This dependency guarantees the ingestion process runs with valid and available data.\n\n```python\nwget_task >> ingest_task\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, the `LocalIngestionDag` automates the task of downloading NYC taxi trip data and ingesting it into a PostgreSQL database on a monthly schedule.
