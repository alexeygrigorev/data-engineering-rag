              "content": "# Google Cloud Storage Upload Script Documentation\n\nThis Python script is designed to download, transform, and upload taxi trip data from NYC's Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. It makes use of pandas for data manipulation, requests for HTTP operations, and the Google Cloud Storage client for uploading files.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore executing this script, ensure the following prerequisites are met:\n\n1. Install necessary Python packages:\n   ```\n   pip install pandas pyarrow google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n2. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to your project/service account key.\n\n3. Define the `GCP_GCS_BUCKET` environment variable to specify your GCS bucket. If not set, it will default to \"dtc-data-lake-bucketname\".\n\n## Constants and URL Setup\n\nThe script initializes a constant URL pointing to the GitHub repository where the NYC TLC data is hosted:\n```python\ninit_url = 'https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/'\n```\nAdditionally, it retrieves the name of the GCS bucket from the environment variable:\n```python\nBUCKET = os.environ.get(\"GCP_GCS_BUCKET\", \"dtc-data-lake-bucketname\")\n```\n\n## Function: upload_to_gcs\n\nThis function is responsible for uploading files to Google Cloud Storage. It takes three parameters: \n\n- `bucket`: The name of the GCS bucket.\n- `object_name`: The name/path under which the file will be stored in GCS.\n- `local_file`: The path of the local file to be uploaded.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nThe function initializes a GCS client, retrieves the specified bucket, and uses it to upload the specified local file. It includes a reference to workarounds for file upload limitations typically faced when files exceed 6 MB in size.\n\n## Function: web_to_gcs\n\nThis function downloads datasets from the web, converts them from CSV format to Parquet format, and uploads them to Google Cloud Storage. It takes two parameters:\n\n- `year`: The year of the data to be processe",

              "content": "d (e.g., '2019', '2020').\n- `service`: The type of taxi service (e.g., 'green', 'yellow').\n\n### Step-by-Step Walkthrough\n\n1. **Monthly Loop**: The function iterates over the months from January to December.\n  \n2. **File Naming**: For each month, it constructs the name of the CSV file using the service type and year. Months are formatted to ensure two digits (e.g., '01', '02').\n\n3. **HTTP Request**: It downloads the CSV file from the constructed URL using the `requests` library. The downloaded content is saved as a local file.\n\n4. **Data Reading and Conversion**: The local CSV file is read into a pandas DataFrame with gzip compression. It is then converted and saved as a Parquet file for efficient storage and querying.\n\n5. **GCS Upload**: The Parquet file is uploaded to the specified GCS bucket using the `upload_to_gcs` function.\n\n6. **Logging**: Throughout the process, the script outputs messages to provide feedback about the local file's creation and successful uploads to GCS.\n\n## Dataset Processing Execution\n\nAt the bottom of the script, two function calls for processing specific years and services are provided:\n\n```python\nweb_to_gcs('2019', 'green')\nweb_to_gcs('2020', 'green')\n```\n\nThese lines indicate that the script is set up to process green taxi data for the years 2019 and 2020. Additional lines for yellow taxi data are commented out, which implies they may be intended for future execution.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis script serves as a straightforward utility for downloading NYC taxi trip data, transforming it into a more efficient format, and uploading it to cloud storage. It can be easily extended by modifying the function calls for different years or service types, enhancing its versatility for various data processing needs.",

To execute it, the user must provide the required parameters through command-line arguments. An example usage would look like:\n\n```bash\npython script.py --user username --password secret --host localhost --port 5432 --db mydatabase --table_name mytable --url http://example.com/data.csv.gz\n```\n\nThis invocation will start the entire data ingestion process described above. \n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe script provides timing feedback for each chunk processed, which can help users understand the performance characteristics of their data ingestion. Given that large datasets can take considerable time to process, this feedback allows for monitoring and potential optimization of the process.\n\n### Final Notes\n\nThis tool is designed specifically for dealing with CSV files intended for PostgreSQL databases. Users should ensure that the CSV data is formatted correctly and that the PostgreSQL table schema is compatible with the incoming data. Modifications to the script may be required if the structure of the CSV changes or if additional data processing is necessary before ingestion.",
