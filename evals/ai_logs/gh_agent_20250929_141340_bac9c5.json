This serves as a basic form of data extraction for further analysis without any partitioning for performance optimizations.\n\n## Creating a Partitioned Table\n\nThe next step involves creating a partitioned version of the yellow taxi trip data:\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned\nPARTITION BY DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) AS\nSELECT * FROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.external_yellow_tripdata;\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: A new table named `yellow_tripdata_partitioned` is created, partitioned by the `tpep_pickup_datetime` field. Partitioning improves query performance by limiting the amount of data scanned when querying by date.\n\n## Comparing Query Performance: Non-Partitioned vs. Partitioned\n\nTwo separate queries evaluate the impact of partitioning on query performance by checking distinct vendor IDs over the same date range:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)\nFROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned\nWHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-06-30';\n\nSELECT DISTINCT(VendorID)\nFROM taxi-rides-ny.nytaxi.yellow_tripdata_partitioned\nWHERE DATE(tpep_pickup_datetime) BETWEEN '2019-06-01' AND '2019-06-30';\n```\n\n- **Purpose**: The first query scans 1.6 GB of data from the non-partitioned table, while the second query only scans approximately 106 MB from the partitioned table. This comparison illustrates the performance benefits gained from partitioning.\n\n## Exploring Partitions\n\nThe subsequent query checks the details of each partition created in the partitioned table:\n\n```sql\nSELECT table_name, partition_id, total_rows\nFROM `nytaxi.INFOR",

          "content": "If you're experiencing performance issues with WSL2, especially when using Docker or other applications, here are some troubleshooting steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Check Docker Configuration**: If you're running Docker in WSL2, you might encounter performance issues due to how Docker uses the filesystem in WSL2. Ensure that your Docker settings are optimized:\n   - Make sure to use the WSL2 backend for Docker Desktop.\n   - Configure resource limits (like CPU and Memory) in Docker Desktop settings that align with your system capabilities.\n\n2. **Accessing Filesystems**: Performance can suffer when accessing files from the Windows filesystem (C:\\) from WSL2. It's recommended to store your project files directly in the WSL2 filesystem (like `/home/yourusername/`) instead of the Windows filesystem. This will drastically improve file I/O performance.\n\n3. **Using VS Code Remote - WSL**: If you are using Visual Studio Code, consider utilizing the Remote - WSL extension for better performance when editing files in WSL.\n\n4. **WSL Version**: Ensure you are using WSL2, which has better performance and features compared to WSL1. You can check your version in PowerShell with the command `wsl -l -v`.\n\n5. **File Sharing and Mount Options**: If you're using shared volumes, be mindful of how they are configured. You might need to adjust the way you mount directories if you're facing slow performance.\n\n6. **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory usage specifically for WSL processes. Use Windows Task Manager or `htop` in WSL to identify any potential bottlenecks.\n\n7. **Reset WSL2**: As a last resort, if none of the above steps help, consider resetting WSL2. This can resolve deeper configuration issues but will require you to reinstall any necessary software.\n\nFor more detailed troubleshooting, you can also refer to a guide on WSL2 performance issues [here](https://gist.github.com/nervuzz/d1afe81116cbfa3c834634ebce7f11c5) that specifically addresses performance problems when using Docker in a Windows/WSL/WSL2 setup.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for specific configuration documents or resources related to your setup, you may not find them directly in the current documentation. However, you can always explore community forums or GitHub repositories for shared experiences and configurations.",
