It outlines the necessary components required to interact with a Kafka topic designed to handle data related to taxi rides.\n\n\n## File Paths\n\n### Input Data Path\n\n```python\nINPUT_DATA_PATH = '../resources/rides.csv'\n```\n\nThis variable specifies the location of a CSV file that contains ride-sharing data. The path is relative to the current working directory, directing to the `resources` directory where the `rides.csv` file is stored. This file likely contains structured data pertaining to individual taxi rides, such as timestamps, passenger counts, pickup and drop-off locations, and fare information.\n\n\n### Schema Paths\n\n```python\nRIDE_KEY_SCHEMA_PATH = '../resources/schemas/taxi_ride_key.avsc'\nRIDE_VALUE_SCHEMA_PATH = '../resources/schemas/taxi_ride_value.avsc'\n```\n\nThese variables define paths to Avro schema files used to enforce data structure and validation for the ride-sharing data. \n\n- **Key Schema** (`taxi_ride_key.avsc`): This schema is likely responsible for defining the structure of data keys used in Kafka, typically to identify unique records.\n  \n- **Value Schema** (`taxi_ride_value.avsc`): This schema describes the structure of the data values (payload) carried by the records relating to taxi rides, dictating what fields should be included and their types (e.g., strings, integers, dates).\n\n\n## Kafka Configuration\n\n### Schema Registry URL\n\n```python\nSCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL = 'http://localhost:8081'\n```\n\nThis variable indicates the URL of the Schema Registry, which is essential for managing and retrieving Avro schemas dynamically. The Schema Registry exists as a service that allows producers and consumers of Kafka messages to store and retrieve schema definitions. The URL points to a local instance, suggesting that the schema registry service is running on the same machine.\n\n\n### Bootstrap Servers\n\n```python\nBOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = 'localhost:9092'\n```\n\nThis variable specifies the address of the Kafka broker(s) that the application will connect to for producing and consuming messages. In this case, it points to a local Kafka server running on port 9092. This is the entry point for communication with the Kafka ecosystem.\n\n\n### Kafka Topic\n\n```python\nKAFKA_TOPIC = 'rides_avro'\n```\n\nThis variable defines the Kafka topic named `rides_avro`, where the ride-sharing data will be published and consumed. Topics in Kafka serve as categories or feeds to which records are sent, and they play a critical role in how data is organized and processed.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet serves as a fundamental configuration block for an application that aims to process taxi ride data using Kafka and Avro for serialization. The specified file paths, schema registry URL, bootstrap servers, and Kafka topic provide the necessary parameters for the program to effectively read ride data from a CSV file, validate it against defined schemas, and interact with Kafka's messaging system for data flow.",

It leverages the KafkaProducer from the Kafka library to facilitate message queueing and delivery. The provided settings such as bootstrap servers and input data path are fetched from external configuration files.\n\n## Imports\nThe script begins by importing necessary modules and classes:\n- `csv`: For reading data from CSV files.\n- `json`: For serializing ride data into JSON format.\n- `List`, `Dict`: For type hinting, improving clarity of function signatures.\n- `KafkaProducer`, `KafkaTimeoutError`: For creating a producer instance to send messages to a Kafka topic and handling potential timeout exceptions.\n- `Ride`: A custom class that is presumed to encapsulate the details of a ride record.\n- `settings`: External settings importing for configuration constants.\n\n## Class: JsonProducer\nThe `JsonProducer` class extends `KafkaProducer` and encapsulates functionality specific to producing JSON serialized data to Kafka:\n\n### Constructor: `__init__`\n```python\ndef __init__(self, props: Dict):\n    self.producer = KafkaProducer(**props)\n```\n- Initializes the Kafka producer with provided properties defined in a dictionary, allowing for flexible and adjustable configurations.\n\n### Static Method: `read_records`\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n```\n- Accepts a file path as input and reads ride records from a CSV file.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Opens the specified CSV file for reading.\n  - Uses the `csv.reader` to parse the file, skipping the header.\n  - For each row, it creates an instance of `Ride` initialized with the row data and collects them into a list.\n  \n### Method: `publish_rides`\n```python\ndef publish_rides(self, topic: str, messages: List[Ride]):\n```\n- Responsible for sending ride messages to a specified Kafka topic.\n- **Functionality**:\n  - Iterates over a list of `Ride` objects, converting each one into a message format suitable for Kafka.\n  - Calls `self.producer.send()` to publish each ride.\n  - Handles `KafkaTimeoutError` to catch errors during sending, logging the issue to the console alongside the affected ride's location ID.\n\n## Main Execution Block\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n```\n- This block ensures that the following code only runs when the script is executed as a standalone program and not when imported as a module.\n\n### Configuration Initialization\n```python\nconfig = {\n    'bootstrap_servers': BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS,\n    'key_serializer': lambda key: str(key).encode(),\n    'value_serializer': lambda x: json.dumps(x.__dict__, default=str).encode('utf-8')\n}\n```\n- Constructs a configuration dictionary containing:\n  - `bootstrap_servers`: The address(es) of Kafka brokers, loaded from the settings.\n  - `key_serializer`: A lambda function that encodes keys as byte strings for Kafka compatibility.\n  - `value_serializer`: A lambda function that converts objects to JSON format before sending to Kafka.\n\n### Producer Instantiation and Record Processing\n```python\nproducer = JsonProducer(props=config)\n```\n- Creates an instance of `JsonProducer` using the defined configuration.\n\n### Reading Records\n```python\nrides = producer.read_records(resource_path=INPUT_DATA_PATH)\n```\n- Calls the `read_records` method to load ride data from the specified CSV file path (retrieved from settings).\n\n### Publishing Rides to Kafka\n```python\nproducer.publish_rides(topic=KAFKA_TOPIC, messages=rides)\n```\n- Finally, the script calls the `publish_rides` method to send all the ride records to the predefined Kafka topic.\n\n## Summary\nIn summary, this script establishes a Kafka producer, reads ride data from a specified CSV file converting each row into `Ride` objects, and publishes these rides as JSON-serialized messages to a specified Kafka topic. It handles potential errors during the publishing process, making it robust for production scenarios.",

It reads records from a CSV file, serializes them according to predefined schemas, and publishes them to a Kafka topic, providing a delivery report on the success or failure of each message sent.\n\n## Key Imports\n\n1. **OS and CSV Libraries**: Used for file handling and parsing CSV files.\n2. **Confluent Kafka Library**: This library provides the necessary tools for producing messages to Kafka and for Avro serialization.\n3. **Custom Modules**: \n   - `ride_record_key` and `ride_record`: These modules define the data structures for the ride records and their keys.\n   - `settings`: Configuration parameters for Kafka, schema paths, and input data paths.\n\n## Delivery Report Function\n\n```python\ndef delivery_report(err, msg):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis function is called after attempting to send a message to Kafka. It checks for errors during the delivery process:\n- If an error occurred, it outputs an error message indicating which record failed.\n- If successful, it logs the details of the successfully produced record, including the topic, partition, and offset.\n\n## RideAvroProducer Class\n\n### Initialization\n\n```python\nclass RideAvroProducer:\n    def __init__(self, props: Dict):\n        ...\n```\n\nUpon instantiation, the `RideAvroProducer` class synchronizes with the schema registry and initializes the necessary serializers. It does the following:\n1. Loads the key and value schemas from the provided schema paths.\n2. Configures the Schema Registry client.\n3. Initializes Avro serializers for both keys and values.\n4. Sets up a Kafka producer with the provided bootstrap servers.\n\n### Load Schema\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef load_schema(schema_path: str):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis static method reads and returns the content of a schema file given its path. It ensures that the producer can utilize appropriate serialization/deserialization schemas.\n\n### Read Records\n\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef read_records(resource_path: str):\n    ...\n```\n\nThis static method reads ride records from a CSV file:\n- It skips the header row and processes each subsequent row.\n- Constructs `RideRecord` and `RideRecordKey` instances based on specific columns of the CSV data.\n- Returns a zipped list of keys and values.\n\n### Publish Method\n\n```python\ndef publish(self, topic: str, records: [RideRecordKey, RideRecord]):\n    ...\n```\n\nThe `publish` method takes a Kafka topic and a series of ride records as inputs. It processes each record:\n1. Serializes the key and value using the Avro serializers.\n2. Sends each record to Kafka with an associated delivery report callback.\n3. It catches any exceptions and breaks on a keyboard interrupt.\n4. After sending all records, it flushes the producer, ensuring that all messages are delivered before closing, and introduces a brief sleep to manage the flow.\n\n## Main Execution Block\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ...\n```\n\nWhen the script is executed directly:\n1. It constructs a configuration dictionary with necessary Kafka and schema registry properties.\n2. Instantiates a `RideAvroProducer` object with this configuration.\n3. Calls the `read_records` method to fetch ride records from the specified CSV file.\n4. Publishes the read records to the specified Kafka topic using the `publish` method.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis script effectively integrates with Kafka and Avro serialization, showcasing how to read data from a CSV, serialize it, and send it to a Kafka topic. The `RideAvroProducer` class encapsulates all functionalities related to Kafka production, focusing on schema management, message publishing, and handling delivery reports. This composition supports a clean and extensible approach for producing ride record data in a real-time streaming application.",

          "content": "To install and use Kafka in Python, you typically have a couple of options, including popular libraries like `kafka-python` and `confluent-kafka`. Below are the steps to get started:\n\n### 1. Install Kafka Library\n\nFor basic usage, you can use the `kafka-python` library:\n\n```bash\npip install kafka-python\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you need features like Avro serialization, you might prefer `confluent-kafka`:\n\n```bash\npip install confluent-kafka\n```\n\n### 2. Setting up Kafka\n\nBefore you can interact with Kafka from Python, ensure that you have Kafka running. This often involves using Docker to set up Kafka and Zookeeper. Here\u2019s a brief overview of the steps:\n\n1. **Set up Docker Network & Volume:**\n\n   ```bash\n   docker network create kafka-spark-network\n   docker volume create --name=hadoop-distributed-file-system\n   ```\n\n2. **Run Kafka using Docker Compose:**\n\n   You can start Kafka and Zookeeper services through Docker Compose:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker compose up -d\n   ```\n\nMake sure to check the Docker documentation on how to set up these services if you\u2019re unfamiliar with it.\n\n### 3. Sample Producer and Consumer Scripts\n\nOnce Kafka is running, you can write scripts to produce and consume messages. For example:\n\n**Producer Example** (using `kafka-python`):\n```python\nfrom kafka import KafkaProducer\nimport json\n\nproducer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',\n                         value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))\n\nproducer.send('my-topic', {'key': 'value'})\nproducer.flush()\n```\n\n**Consumer Example**:\n```python\nfrom kafka import KafkaConsumer\n\nconsumer = KafkaConsumer('my-topic', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',\n                         auto_offset_reset='earliest')\n\nfor message in consumer:\n    print(f\"Received: {message.value}\")\n```\n\nEnsure that your Kafka broker address matches the one you're using in your local setup.\n\n### References\n\nFor additional details about using Kafka with Python, you can refer to the streaming documentation in the provided course materials: [Stream-Processing with Python](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/README.md) \n\nIf further configurations like Avro serialization are needed, consult the appropriate examples, such as the Avro producer example: [Avro Producer Example](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/avro_example/producer.py).",
