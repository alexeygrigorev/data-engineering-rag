It outlines the necessary components required to interact with a Kafka topic designed to handle data related to taxi rides.\n\n\n## File Paths\n\n### Input Data Path\n\n```python\nINPUT_DATA_PATH = '../resources/rides.csv'\n```\n\nThis variable specifies the location of a CSV file that contains ride-sharing data. The path is relative to the current working directory, directing to the `resources` directory where the `rides.csv` file is stored. This file likely contains structured data pertaining to individual taxi rides, such as timestamps, passenger counts, pickup and drop-off locations, and fare information.\n\n\n### Schema Paths\n\n```python\nRIDE_KEY_SCHEMA_PATH = '../resources/schemas/taxi_ride_key.avsc'\nRIDE_VALUE_SCHEMA_PATH = '../resources/schemas/taxi_ride_value.avsc'\n```\n\nThese variables define paths to Avro schema files used to enforce data structure and validation for the ride-sharing data. \n\n- **Key Schema** (`taxi_ride_key.avsc`): This schema is likely responsible for defining the structure of data keys used in Kafka, typically to identify unique records.\n  \n- **Value Schema** (`taxi_ride_value.avsc`): This schema describes the structure of the data values (payload) carried by the records relating to taxi rides, dictating what fields should be included and their types (e.g., strings, integers, dates).\n\n\n## Kafka Configuration\n\n### Schema Registry URL\n\n```python\nSCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL = 'http://localhost:8081'\n```\n\nThis variable indicates the URL of the Schema Registry, which is essential for managing and retrieving Avro schemas dynamically. The Schema Registry exists as a service that allows producers and consumers of Kafka messages to store and retrieve schema definitions. The URL points to a local instance, suggesting that the schema registry service is running on the same machine.\n\n\n### Bootstrap Servers\n\n```python\nBOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = 'localhost:9092'\n```\n\nThis variable specifies the address of the Kafka broker(s) that the application will connect to for producing and consuming messages. In this case, it points to a local Kafka server running on port 9092. This is the entry point for communication with the Kafka ecosystem.\n\n\n### Kafka Topic\n\n```python\nKAFKA_TOPIC = 'rides_avro'\n```\n\nThis variable defines the Kafka topic named `rides_avro`, where the ride-sharing data will be published and consumed. Topics in Kafka serve as categories or feeds to which records are sent, and they play a critical role in how data is organized and processed.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, this code snippet serves as a fundamental configuration block for an application that aims to process taxi ride data using Kafka and Avro for serialization. The specified file paths, schema registry URL, bootstrap servers, and Kafka topic provide the necessary parameters for the program to effectively read ride data from a CSV file, validate it against defined schemas, and interact with Kafka's messaging system for data flow.",

              "content": "# Kafka Consumer Documentation\n\n## Overview\nThis code implements a Kafka consumer that reads messages from a specified Kafka topic, particularly aimed at processing CSV data related to rides. It utilizes the `kafka-python` library to manage the communication with Kafka. The consumer will connect to a Kafka instance, subscribe to a topic, and continuously poll for messages, printing their keys and values until interrupted.\n\n## Dependencies\nThe script imports several modules:\n- `argparse`: Used for command-line argument parsing.\n- `Dict` and `List` from `typing`: Used for type hinting, enhancing code readability.\n- `KafkaConsumer` from `kafka`: Main class to interact with Kafka for consuming messages.\n- `settings`: Custom settings module that provides configuration variables for Kafka connection.\n\n## RideCSVConsumer Class\n### Initialization\n```python\nclass RideCSVConsumer:\n    def __init__(self, props: Dict):\n        self.consumer = KafkaConsumer(**props)\n```\nThis class is initialized with a dictionary of properties (`props`) necessary for the Kafka consumer. The `KafkaConsumer` instance is created using these properties, establishing the connection to the Kafka broker(s).\n\n### Consuming Messages\n```python\ndef consume_from_kafka(self, topics: List[str]):\n```\nThe `consume_from_kafka` method subscribes to the specified Kafka topics and enters a loop that polls for messages. \n\n- **Subscription**: It subscribes to the provided topics and confirms the subscription.\n- **Message Polling**: The method repeatedly polls for new messages using a timeout of 1 second.\n  - If no messages are returned, it continues polling.\n  - Upon receiving messages, it iterates through them, printing out each message's key and value along with their data types.\n  \n### Handling Interruptions\nThe method contains a try-except block to gracefully handle keyboard interrupts (SIGINT). When such an interrupt is detected, the loop is exited, and the consumer connection is closed.\n\n```python\nself.consumer.close()\n```\nThis line ensures that the Kafka consumer is properly closed when finished, releasing any resources.\n\n## Main Execution Block\nThe main part of the script handles command-line execution:\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Kafka Consumer')\n```\n- **Argument Parsing**: A command-line parser is created, allowing users to specify the Kafka topic they want to consume. If no topic is provided, it defaults to a value defined in the `settings` module (`CONSUME_TOPIC_RIDES_CSV`).\n\n### Configuration Setup\nThe script then prepares a configuration dictionary, `config`, for the Kafka consumer:\n- `bootstrap_servers`: Specifies the Kafka server(s) to connect to.\n- `auto_offset_reset`: Controls the behavior for resetting offsets; set to 'earliest' to read from the beginning of the topic if there are no previous offsets stored.\n- `enable_auto_commit`: Automatically commits offsets of messages consumed.\n- `key_deserializer` & `value_deserializer`: Functions for deserializing message keys and values; the keys are converted to integers, while values are decoded to strings.\n- `group_id`: Identifies the consumer group to which the consumer belongs.\n\n### Instantiating the Consumer\nFinally, a `RideCSVConsumer` instance is created using the prepared configuration and subscribes to the chosen topic for message consumption.\n\n```python\ncsv_consumer = RideCSVConsumer(props=config)\ncsv_consumer.consume_from_kafka(topics=[topic])\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nThis script serves as a straightforward Kafka consumer implementation. Following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming, it encapsulates functionality focused on consuming messages from Kafka into a class. The command-line interface makes it flexible to specify different topics at runtime, while built-in mechanisms handle message polling and graceful shutdown, ensuring that the consumer operates efficiently and reliably.",

              "content": "# Kafka CSV Producer\n\nThis script is designed to read ride data from a CSV file and send it to a Kafka topic using a Kafka producer. It leverages the `csv`, `json`, and `kafka` libraries in Python, executing a straightforward process to facilitate the transfer of ride information.\n\n## Libraries and Dependencies\n\nThe script begins with the following imports:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom json import dumps\nfrom kafka import KafkaProducer\nfrom time import sleep\n```\n\n- **csv**: This module is used for reading and parsing CSV files. It allows for ease of access to data structured in rows and columns.\n  \n- **json.dumps**: This function converts Python objects into JSON strings, making it suitable for serializing the data before sending it over Kafka.\n\n- **KafkaProducer**: This class from the `kafka` library is used to send messages to a Kafka broker. The producer will be configured later with serializers for the keys and values.\n\n- **time.sleep**: This function pauses the execution of the script for a specified amount of time, allowing for the control of message flow to the Kafka topic.\n\n## Kafka Producer Initialization\n\nA Kafka producer is initialized with specific configurations:\n\n```python\nproducer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],\n                         key_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8'),\n                         value_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8'))\n```\n\n- **bootstrap_servers**: This parameter specifies the address of the Kafka broker. In this case, it points to a local server running on port 9092.\n\n- **key_serializer**: This lambda function serializes the key into a JSON string format and encodes it in UTF-8. The serialization allows the key to be sent as a uniform message over Kafka.\n\n- **value_serializer**: Similar to the key serializer, this function serializes the value to JSON format and encodes it to ensure compatibility with Kafka message formats.\n\n## CSV File Handling\n\nNext, the script opens the CSV file that contains the ride data:\n\n```python\nfile = open('../../resources/rides.csv')\n```\n\n- The relative path indicates that the file is structured within a directory called `resources`. It is assumed that the CSV file contains relevant ride details, potentially structured with various columns for vendor ID, passenger count, trip distance, payment type, and total amount.\n\n## Reading and Processing the CSV\n\nThe script utilizes the `csv.reader` to read the CSV file's content:\n\n```python\ncsvreader = csv.reader(file)\nheader = next(csvreader)\n```\n\n- **header**: The first row of the CSV is typically reserved for column names. Using `next(csvreader)` retrieves this header row and is not subsequently processed.\n\n- The script then iterates over the subsequent rows in the CSV file:\n\n```python\nfor row in csvreader:\n```\n\n## Constructing Message Keys and Values\n\nWithin the loop, each row from the CSV is processed to create a key and value for sending to Kafka:\n\n```python\nkey = {\"vendorId\": int(row[0])}\nvalue = {\"vendorId\": int(row[0]), \"passenger_count\": int(row[3]), \"trip_distance\": float(row[4]), \"payment_type\": int(row[9]), \"total_amount\": float(row[16])}\n```\n\n- **key**: Created as a dictionary with the vendor ID (assumed to be in the first column of the CSV).\n\n- **value**: Constructed as another dictionary containing multiple fields relevant to the taxi ride:\n  - *vendorId*: Vendor ID cast to an integer.\n  - *passenger_count*: Number of passengers, also an integer.\n  - *trip_distance*: Distance of the trip, converted to a float.\n  - *payment_type*: Payment method stored as an integer.\n  - *total_amount*: Total fare for the ride, represented as a float.\n\n## Sending Data to Kafka\n\nThe constructed key and value are sent to the Kafka topic:\n\n```python\nproducer.send('datatalkclub.yellow_taxi_ride.json', value=value, key=key)\n```\n\n- The topic specified is `datatalkclub.yellow_taxi_ride.json`. This indicates that the script is targeting a predefined topic for the storage and analysis of yellow taxi ride data.\n\n## Feedback and Flow Control\n\nAfter sending the message, the script prints a confirmation message and pauses for a second:\n\n```python\nprint(\"producing\")\nsleep(1)\n```\n\n- **Print Statement**: Outputs \"producing\" to the console, indicating successful message production.\n\n- **sleep(1)**: Introduces a one-second delay between messages, which helps manage the load on the Kafka broker and allows for controlled throughput of messages.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn summary, this script effectively captures essential ride-related data from a CSV file and streams it to a Kafka topic. The use of Kafka allows for scalable and reliable message handling, making it suitable for real-time data processing applications. The methodology of key and value construction provides a structured approach for organizing the taxi ride information efficiently.",

Here are the steps to install and set it up:\n\n1. **Install the Kafka Python Library**:\n   You can install `kafka-python` using pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n   ```bash\n   pip install kafka-python\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up Kafka Services**:\n   Before you can use Kafka with Python, you need to have Kafka running. If you're using Docker, you can set up a Kafka environment using Docker containers. Check the `docker-README` file for steps on how to set it up. The documentation includes Dockerfiles and docker-compose definitions to run Kafka and Spark in a Docker container.\n\n3. **Kafka Producer-Consumer Example**:\n   To demonstrate usage, you can follow an example to create a Kafka producer and consumer using the installed library. You would typically have `producer.py` for producing messages and `consumer.py` for consuming them.\n\n   Here\u2019s a basic example of initializing a producer:\n   ```python\n   from kafka import KafkaProducer\n   from json import dumps\n\n   producer = KafkaProducer(\n       bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],\n       value_serializer=lambda x: dumps(x).encode('utf-8')\n   )\n\n   # Sending a message\n   producer.send('your-topic-name', value={'key': 'value'})\n   ```\n\n   In a similar way, you can implement a consumer using `KafkaConsumer` that subscribes to a topic and reads messages:\n   ```python\n   from kafka import KafkaConsumer\n\n   consumer = KafkaConsumer(\n       'your-topic-name',\n       bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],\n       auto_offset_reset='earliest',\n       enable_auto_commit=True,\n       group_id='my-group',\n       value_deserializer=lambda x: x.decode('utf-8')\n   )\n\n   for message in consumer:\n       print(f\"Received message: {message.value}\")\n   ```\n\nFor complete examples and additional details, refer to the [Streaming with Python](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/python/README.md) documentation, which includes producer and consumer examples using the `kafka-python` library.",
