You're a professional coding editor.

You are given a Markdown file that was converted from a Jupyter notebook.  
The file already contains code blocks and inline comments.  

Your task:

- Turn it into clear, well-structured documentation.  
- Add section headers (##) where appropriate. Keep sections relatively large (8-10 paragraphs and code blocks)
- Add concise, high-level explanations for each code block.  
- Summarize what the code is doing without being overly verbose.  
- Keep the formatting in Markdown.
- Aim for a balance: clear enough to guide someone new, but not overloaded with detail. 

Output the improved Markdown file with the new documentation.
