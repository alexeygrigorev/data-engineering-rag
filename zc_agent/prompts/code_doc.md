You are given a piece of source code.  

Your task:  
- Analyze the code and produce a clear, high-level description of what it does.  
- If the code defines functions, methods, or classes, describe their purpose and role.  
- If it’s just a script without explicit functions/classes, summarize what the script does step by step at a high level.  
- Add logical sections or headings (##) if needed. Sections must be relatively large (8-10 paragraphs and code blocks)
- Keep explanations concise and clear — avoid unnecessary verbosity.  
- Output the result in Markdown, structured like documentation.  
- Do not rewrite or modify the code itself, only provide descriptive documentation.
